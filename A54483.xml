            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But this appears, the Grace of God appears, and his free act is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in both. The creature can contribute nothing at firſt: and then though a double cover on the earth of darkneſs and the deep, yet that releaſed by his power infinite, and then having removed the waters alſo by virtue of his Producat, he made the land appear, and ſuddenly diſappear inveſted in a robe of numerous plants and flowers. Juſt ſo in this work of thy new birth, Darkneſs is firſt all over thee, and tis Gods method, firſt darkneſs, and then light. Our imaginations dark, and our fooliſh heart full of darkneſs, and all that men can do in that ſtate of nature, deeds and works of darkneſs; But then comes <hi>oriens ex alto</hi> with his marvellous Light, till the day dawn and Day-ſtar riſe in our hearts.

Then ſee

Firſt, Light makes things diſcernable: in night great ſtones and blocks. So to blind nature groſs ſins lie undiſcovered, till Light of Grace infuſe a tenderneſs and ſcrupuloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a diſcretion, and ability, both to obſerve the ſurprizes of, and ask pardon for the leaſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

But then remember, one deep calls upon another: There is a deep of Mercy anſwers the depth of all our miſery, and to top this Conſolation, if the waves of ungodlineſs make us afraid and roar horribly, or after a ſenſe of Mercy and Forgiveneſs, we fear the reflux and revaleſcency of our prevailing ſins upon us: Remember his bow is in the clouds: his gracious promiſe in his holy Word to make his Power perfect in weakneſs; and he hath given to the Sea a Law, and ſaid to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further; and here ſtay thy proud waves:</p>

When the Angel came to ſalute her; when Chriſt came to <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> one with tidings of her conceiving the Son of God; the other with ſtrange news, of a man being born again, and ſo become the Son of God: both wondred alike, both ask in effect the ſelf ſame queſtion; <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> How can a man be born again and take notice? the anſwer is the ſame to both; for there is no other. The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee: the Power of the moſt High ſhall do this in an act of as great freed om as the blowing of the wind: ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit. A ſecond conſiderable comfort is that of infinite diſtance.

And to conclude this point, As Chriſt was not ſent till the fulneſs of time, not preſently after the fall; a ſenſe and diſcovery of ſins power muſt precede, ere we find our need of his powerful blood; and man firſt ſent to reaſon, and to the Law under School-maſters to bring us to Chriſt: ſo the Spirit of Grace falls down in infinite Power, and in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Union; and yet performs the work in meaſure and by degrees; which it could do by one Ranſack and Deſtruction of all ſin and infirmitie at once. But for convenience and fit appliance to the Receiver, it proceeds leiſurely to fill our narrow veſſels, and ſtays that very ſeaſon till the water be troubled; mans heart made ready by remorſe; when he perceives himſelf ſinking, and is at it with <hi>Save Lord, we periſh;</hi> and all this that the excellency of the power might be, and might be felt and acknowledged to be of God, and not of us.</p>

Even Kings of the earth drunk; And ſhall we ſtartle or ſcruple at this Cup of Chriſt? What! Sit at my right hand in Glory, and ſhame to taſte a little ſhame and bitterneſs of a Croſs and Cup which I have born and drunk off before you! Remember <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is in the bottom: what if it ſhould make you ſweat and pant in getting off this health! Do but think how oft you have enforced your ſelves to take down thoſe healths falſly ſo called! and ſuffer then the word of exhortation which preſſes you down upon your knees, to beg this pledge at the hand of your Soveraign Lord and Maker; as his ſervant did, <hi>Pota me Domine torrente voluptatis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin;</hi> — for ſo you ſhall find it in the end; though you ſhould be compelled for Chriſts ſake and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels to drink it blood warm, and in a fiery tryal. So much the ſweeter by his Grace and Power ſeaſoning it, who by his own example hath ſo begun it to us. Secondly, A Convenience in reference to our ſelves. This Cup muſt down or elſe another that is worſe;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107154:21"/>and there is but another, and that is in the hand of the Lord too; wherein the wine is red and it is full mixt, and the wicked of the earth muſt drink and wring out the dregs of Gods wrath. If we would ſcape that drench and bane of ſoul and body, which but begins the torment of thoſe damned Spirits, who muſt for ever drink it burning hot in a lake of fire and brimſtone: Reſolve, and ſpeedily to taſte and conſider how gracious and ſweet his offered Mercies are in Chriſt: and if we would ſhun that Cup of his vengeance which runs out for the ſeirce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, take then to day while it is called to day, and while we are called to day, this Cup of his Mercy which runs over for the ſulneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As thus for Conveniency; ſo is this <hi>Recipe</hi> to be preſt on all for neceſſity, abſolute; Wo to me if I do not preach, or preach it dully or lazily; and wo unto you if you receive it not as the <hi>unum neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> For ſhall we need any more Receipts?

Such a Merchant might have all the Lords and Ladies, and all the Kings of the earth his Clients and Patients. Alas! Is our ſoul and inward beauty leſs precious; Why? Here it is that will cure all ſinfull diſtempers: Reſtore thy ſoul her native Candor, and ſweetneſs, and ingenuity, making thee young and luſtie as an Eagle. Make all their eyes that be of a right aerie; able by a lively faith to look up and contemplate that ſun: where the body of that light is, there will the Eagles be gathered together, and that body is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107154:22"/>here. 'Tis the very <hi>Vitis</hi> and Vitals, and the Corps of my Text. Let me not loſe you then: Be gathered ſtill in the continuance of your gracious and patient At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
               <p>For now the laſt way I am to urge this health for neceſſity reſpective: on thoſe firſt that deny the Lord that bought them, either directly (as the <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> do) or indirectly, yet deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately would undermine our faith and ſap out of the corner ſtone, on which all relies, by ruining ſome other parts of the building. Theſe boaſt themſelves the rational diſcourſers of the age; ſuch as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> means in that queſtion, <hi>Where is the Diſputer of this world?</hi> For theſe dare diſpute openly againſt the Creation related by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and juſtified by Chriſt, and quarrel the ſouls immortality, and the bodies reſurrection, which are all heads upon the ſame ſtring, faſtened with our faith in <hi>Vitis</hi> here for our principal Jewel; which if any of theſe fall looſe, is loſt for ever, and then all our preaching and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, and your hearing and receiving, vain; and we be ſtript of our whole Creed; even from God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and earth, along to Chriſt crucified, and on to life everlaſting. But we have not ſo weakly learned Chriſt, to be ſhaken from our botome with ſuch wind and waves of wicked Diſputants; Let us take heed of infection from a ſecond ſort, ſuch as in deeds deny him, having a ſhew but no power of godlineſs; ſuch as may be tract like the ſnail by their unclean and ſlimy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; and yet dare reſolve it in the Imparative, Let us leave ſome Tokens of our wantoneſs, ſo of our prophaneſs, blaſphemie, drunkenneſs in every
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107154:22"/>place: This is a large field and a common place: but for I am upon an health, ſuffer me to ſingle him out, and ſay a coolword or two this morning next his heart unto the drunkard; ſuch eſpecially as in a more then barbarous cuſtom, (for in <hi>Eſt.</hi> 1. no man might compell) by forcing healths, make it yet a more ſickly and diſorderly drunkenneſs. Firſt, I commend to their conſideration St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiphany, where the Grace of God comes; it appears ſaith he, and how? teaching us to denie ungodlineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to live ſoberly. So then where ſobrieey is not learnt, the Grace of Chriſt hath appeared in vain; Then that Caveat of our Saviour which he gave even to his own Apoſtles, <hi>Take heed leſt your hearts be overcome with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs:</hi> Why? Whats the danger? and ſo that day come upon you unwares. My next is that Redoubt and <hi>Barricado</hi> rather of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> wherewith he makes out the enemie, the Lion: At one end he plants the great Ordinance of Faith; Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith. At the other, he makes it ſure, and ſets good guard, <hi>Be ſober and watch;</hi> as if all our faith without ſobriety would not keep out the devil, that roaring Adverſary; who can out-roar theſe roars, and devour theſe Devourers of drink. My cloſe ſhall be that terrible ſentence of the great Judge of heaven and earth gone out againſt them! <hi>That they ſhall never inherit the Kingdom of heaven.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. AND firſt, The Poor. With him I ſhall deal as uſually men do: diſpatch him briefly. Yet ſuch are near and dear unto the Vine, and ſent as Leiger-Embaſſadours, and <hi>à Latere</hi> too, cut like another <hi>Eve</hi> out of his own bleeding ſide. Members of that miſtical Body, whereof he is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head; and whoever wrongs, oppreſſes, grinds or pares them to the blood, He cries in Heaven, —<hi>Non cruor hic de ſtipite manat?</hi>— I am Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> whom thou perſecuteſt. It will come all to one in the end. In as much as you have done it to them, you have done it to me. On the other ſide, Do them good, relieve them, and he will reward it, and make them able to requite it in proportion. Receive them to harbour, and thoſe friends ſhall ſtand at heaven-gate, to receive you into everlaſting habitations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prieſt would be received too: For, Is not he in <hi>Vitis?</hi> He that receives you, receives me: And is not our Miniſtry <hi>Vitis laetificans?</hi> chearing God and man! Did not the firſt Preachers receive
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107154:23"/>largely for themſelves and you, when they received the holy Ghoſt: and received power from on high at Chriſts aſcenſion, and gifts for men! and were not the Apoſtles an odour of a ſweet ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God, and to men that received it, <hi>even the ſavour of life unto life!</hi> And is there not a <hi>Botrus</hi> of Bleſſing ſtill received in receiving our Miniſtry? If it be ſaith which is receiving Chriſt, it is the word of God which we preach: Nay, May we not in a ſober ſenſe ask, What have you that you have not received if it concern your ſpiritual ſtate? Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, matriculation, ablution from ſin at one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt in baptiſm. The body and blood and ſpirit of your Saviour by frequent receivings of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, which (by the way, now let me tell you in a word <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis</hi>) if you ſhould change for the maſs it would leſſen your receipts: for whereas no lay-perſon hath a drop of the chalice allowed; yet they have a Miſſale caſe, that if any of the Conſecrate-wine fall on the floore or pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in that caſe a lay body may be permitted to lick it up left the dog ſhould. A fair reward it will be for ſuch as decline to that Religion: that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hides away and denies the uſe of the word it ſelf which is the power and wiſedom of God to mans ſalvation. But to fall back to our reckoning and Receipts: is there nothing elſe? Remember at night when you go to bed, what is ſhe, (if any be) that ſleeps in your boſome, if you have not received her at the hand of ſome ordered and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter? And when you ſhall go to your lateſt bed, the Grave, what difference from brute animals, if we aſſiſt not to make it an honeſt and honourable
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107154:24"/>Sepulture! ſtrange that mankind cannot well come in, nor well ſtay, nor well go out of this world without us, and yet the world hates us! Doth not this deſerve a Torcular! And I need not here preſs the cup of Comfort; all apt enough to receive that benefits of Light and Salt; and few ſo ſenſleſs, but perceive it would be a very dark and a flaſh, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury dwelling here without the Goſpel: even ſtony ground will take in the Seed, and gladly. But where's the Conſideration of what is due to us? And here I ſpare you: I will not preſs that in the old Teſtament, of Honouring God with your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and firſt fruits and tithe of all that you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. I know the evaſion; you would turn over a new leaf, and turn me to the new Prieſthood in the New Teſtament: yet take heed what you do: for what is the news there? How ſoon in that primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church do you meet with fellers of Poſſeſſions, and laying all at the Apoſtles feet? that's a <hi>Torcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> indeed, and puts me in mind of a pretty paſſage in <hi>Tannerns</hi> a Jeſuit, who wiſhes withall his heart, that all the Kings in Chriſtendom would come and bring in all that ever they have, and put it in their Churches treaſury, and henceforth be ruled by her; but his Concluſion I like beſt; <hi>Hoc in aeternum nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſſions: ſuch as look to the ſtate of your land, or ſtate of your bodies. What a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Covenant ſeems to be driven with ſome of theſe, almoſt in terms of Matrimony? for better or worſe, in Sickneſs and in Health: what? and keep you only to them too; and are the Juriſconſults of Gods Law, and Phyſitians of the ſoul perſons of no value? Laſtly, Is it not a world of wonder to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how all <hi>Regard</hi> runs down and ſtreams in bounteous manner on both ſides of us, and leaves us drie in the middle between thoſe two extreams? The Stately Jeſuit how is he received, even to the adoration of his Fatherhoods venerable ſlipper; and what is his errand? to ſeduce you from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of a Grave and Modeſt Matron your Mother, who hath bred and fed you with the Milk of the Word, and Blood of your Redeemer; and cauſe you to embrace that painted Gentlewoman on the ſeven hills, who if ſhe be not ſhe, is yet as like the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> as ſhe can look: on the other ſide the factious creeping Sectary is admired and applauded by too many; as if he were a veſſel of ſome burden, when indeed he is but an empty frigat, and not able to endure a grapling. Mean ſpace the plain down right Proteſtant that keeps the higher road, the King of Heavens high way to truth, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107154:25"/>maintains that only Doctrine and Diſcipline which for 1600 years by juſt devolution is deſcended line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the Apoſtles and Apoſtolick men, and is able to demonſtrate and make it good in the face of both thoſe adverſaries, is not received, but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived, and abaſed, and abuſed by vulgar ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. But I hope, yea I know better things by you, and ſuch as accompany Salvation, of whom I know alſo I ſhall obtain a gratious pardon for this long Invective: for alas! the time is fully come for us to take up that prayer and complaint of the Princely Prophet: <hi>Have mercy upon us O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly deſpiſed. Our ſoul is filled with the ſcornful Rebuke, and with the deſpightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both of the proud and ignorant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I dare not leave out the King, who is a main Receiver of Chriſt: <hi>Rex</hi> is in <hi>Vitis; per me;</hi> nay <hi>in me Reges</hi> too; and Chriſt our Supream Monarch conveighs both our piety and our peace through earthly Kings: Prayer for them firſt of all: for in that prayer all others are included, that we under them may lead a godly and a quiet life. And as <hi>Rex</hi> is in the vine; ſo he is a fruitful vine too, and a main ſpreading tree, like that <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions in <hi>Tacape,</hi> within whoſe wide embrace a number of other trees were imboſom'd, and received their foſtering and education. So under the Labels and Infules of the Crown (as under a Canopy) ſits every man arbourd and ſheltered enjoying his own vine and branches round about him, with a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous trail and bunch of bleſſings, for which I muſt refer you to two places of Scripture; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. and <hi>Eſai.</hi> 32.2. What might be added here of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107154:25"/>by Land in our peaceable protection hitherto by means of <hi>Judex</hi> and <hi>Vindex,</hi> twixt plea and plea, twixt blood and blood, without which what would become of the Poſſeſſions and Priviledge, the Right and Property of the Subject? and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings by water in thoſe winged <hi>Mercuries,</hi> and well armed Martial Counſellors, ſhould the enemy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign ſpeak in defyance, our beſt and ableſt Agents to break off the Treaty. And doth not all this deſerve a <hi>Torcular</hi> to preſs this <hi>Racemus,</hi> yielding ſuch a fat full of bleſſings! Indeed for the cup of Conſolation, the happineſs enjoyed under Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government, every man can open his mouth wide, and ſwallow the profits and the pleaſures of and under it. But where's our cup of Conformity to the Rulers Juſtice, and Temperance, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Chaſt beams, and ſweet indulgent graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and merciful Diſpoſition? But I forgot the cup of Conſideration, and ſo we are apt all to do the Conſideration of our Duty. We mark well that part of the prayer — <hi>that the King knowing whoſe Miniſter he is, &amp;c.</hi> but quite forget the other part, <hi>That we duly conſidering whoſe authority he hath, may faithfully ſerve, honour and humbly obey him.</hi> Hath not God joyned thoſe Duties, <hi>Fear God, Honour the King,</hi> ſo cloſe, there is no pauſe nor breath betwixt them? And what God hath ſo join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will any vain man blow aſunder? Nor think this a drie and dull piece of Divinity, becauſe every bird in the painted cloth hath this in his mouth, and every ſign of the Bell can ſay as much: for I could wiſh we had more birds taught to ſing this note of <hi>Ave Caeſar;</hi> and that all our Bells, ſpecially all

                  <hi>Aarons</hi> bells would leave their janglings, and agree to ring this Peal in all mens ears: for whereſoever thoſe words are written, they are written for our Inſtruction, and ought to be written (as the Law of God) upon all our foreheads, and in the Palms of all Subjects hands, for the admonition and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering of their hearts, both when they lie down, and when they riſe up: I will end in Vote and Prayer for Royal <hi>Charilaus</hi>

It hath other names here, of Rebuke, Slander, Blaſphemy, three Channels all drain'd into one ſink of <hi>Opprobrium.</hi> That is the Monſter: the Bawling <hi>Cerberus,</hi> foaming with <hi>Aconitum,</hi> a ſtrong poiſon working and drenching through all; and if it light upon a King, you ſee it obſtructs his Pectoral parts; ſits near his very heart; <hi>geſtare in ſinu</hi> doth not ſignifie nothing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But what cauſeth this Maladie? whence comes fit? not <hi>deſuper,</hi> not from the Father of Light; from him none but good and perfect Gifts: nor from his Son; whoſe wiſdom is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be intreated; <hi>who when he was reviled, reviled not again:</hi> nor comes it from that Spirit which proceeds from them both; which came down in ſhape of a Dove: it comes the other way then: <hi>de ſubter,</hi> from the fowl unclean ſpirit; from the Prince of Darkneſs. A dire and dreadful vapour it is from Hell, that blaſts the day and all the children of light. But yet ſo welcome is this ſpirit to the ſpirit of a meer natural man (while it luſteth after envy and lies ſoakt in fleſh and blood) that the carnal man loves it as his own fleſh and blood, nouriſhes and cheriſhes it, till wonted once and grown familiar, it goes from man to man, and from houſe to houſe: — <hi>&amp; creſcit eundo,</hi> grows a foggy, ugly, unweldly and monſtruous thing; and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107154:28"/>that it fall among a crew of <hi>Populorum,</hi> and gathers ſtill upon <hi>multorum &amp; maximorum;</hi> then it ſoon poiſons and putrifies, it condenſes and putrifies the very air, hurls rotten and killing ſlanders round about the earth, and ſhoots up blaſphemies as high as heaven.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We may go another way to work, and ſeek theſe blatant beaſts, Infamy and Blaſphemy, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Reproach, and find them all concentred in St. <hi>James</hi> his world of wickedneſs; and a fitter Centre can never be; for as in this great world we have infinite atomes, feathers and duſt flying aloft, but maſſie and droſſie things ſink downward to the centre of the earth.

Thus having fixt upon this Centre, ſee if the Text will furniſh out a Circumference; and here are choice materials; for of whom ſpeaks the Prophet this? of himſelf, or of ſome other? of himſelf and very many other. We are told this <hi>Pſalm</hi> and the former were made by two Brothers, <hi>Ethan</hi> and <hi>Heman;</hi> and by them caſt as two Molds of Prayer both in private difficulties, (for which the former) and in publike affliction, or ſubverſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike, in which this Pſalm is the pattern: both prepared to warn and arm Gods people of and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107154:28"/>againſt dangers; and both applicatory to Chriſt and his Church in all ages. I told you <hi>Opprobrium</hi> would draw to it all the matter, and take in all the perſons in the Text: and more (it ſeems) then I conceived to be therein contained at firſt; for now we may include all the Lords ſervants at large; and then all his Chiefs. <hi>David,</hi> and every anointed of the Lord: and then the Lord Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, and God in his unſpeakable name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> too. this Circumference will embeliſh our skeme; and yet as high, and holy, and heavenly as theſe perſons are, they may be vext and endangered by this malady; all infeſted or offended from this Center.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Not poſſible! Is this in the power of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulorum?</hi> What Sling, What Engine, What Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance have they to ſhoot as high as Heaven? The Sun can dart a raie down through the bowels of the earth; The Dog-ſtar fling pernitious defluxions; But theſe Caniculars that grin like a Dog, and run through the City, can they from a throat, like an open Sepulcher, vent ſuch a ſteam, ſuch a rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and deſtructive vapour as will kill at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Should Earth ſwell out into 10000 Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nariffs, they could not bore the moon; Earths ſhadows run into nothing before they reach the Sun.

The race of <hi>Populorum maximorum,</hi> and all came from the Duſt; which is the Serpents food; and we are all the worſe to this day for the Serpents tooth in the forbidden fruit; and worſt of all for the Serpents

For the devil infuſing this venom into thoſe Giants, enflamed them to the ſcaling of <hi>Joves</hi> Throne: or if not that, we will believe the Scripture, that if <hi>Nimrod</hi> the mighty light upon a rout of <hi>Populorum,</hi> ſuch babling and bawling ſots as he found in <hi>Shinar,</hi> all of one lip, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.1. they in their wicked conſpiracy, (ſo it is called) <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 10.5. would ſoon be at it for a City and Tower unperiſhable.

            <p n="9">9.

            <p n="1">1. Prayer in general, it is the invention of Gods people from the beginning. Tents and Iron-works from <hi>Cain</hi> and His, but Invocation from <hi>Enos</hi> and his royal Progeny; and God would have it ſo. Ever ſince he kept houſe on earth, it muſt be called an <hi>Houſe of Prayer</hi> for all Nations, all that would be of the houſhold of faith and fellowſhip of the Saints. If that honour, then this work which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107154:36"/>pleaſes God above incenſe, and doth him more honour then all burnt Sacrifice: But what good to his ſervants? all the good our hearts can deſire; for would we do Wonders, drie up Seas, cleave Rocks, ſtop the Sun, or the Lions rage, quench the violence of fire, ſubdue Armies, Kingdoms, or over-power created and increated Nature, bind down the hands of God himſelf, Prayer hath done this, and more, with that Prayer of <hi>Bow the heavens and come down,</hi> the Church of God brought down that Jeſus, at whoſe name we <hi>bow,</hi> who bows the Spirit of God to us, into us, and fills us full of Grace and Truth, of Faith, and Hope, and Love, and Joy, and all thoſe Graces which ſerve to bring us in Grace, and to reconcile us (though ſinners and enemies) to the Father through the Son, as he proclaims the Peace himſelf <hi>In quo acquieſco.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Speciaily Prayer is prevalent in this particular textual diſeaſe and malady of <hi>Opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Our Litany with <hi>Libora nos Domine,</hi> is the beſt Ditany to throw off this arrow; to return and repay, and requite it into their boſom that annoy, us is but <hi>Lutum luto purgare.</hi> No, though it be a caſe which nearly concerns us, and an offence of an high nature, yet our beſt way is to remove it to the higheſt court of audience in Heaven before the Judge of all the world, where we have <hi>advocatum Regium,</hi> and the darling and favorite of that court to plead our cauſe, which is his own, and who took this courſe himſelf; reviled not again, but commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107154:37"/>it to him that judges righteouſly.

            <p n="5">5. Laſtly. This particular Prayer of <hi>David, Recordare Domine,</hi> a word including all Law of God, all Duty of man, all Sermons, and all Prayers. For as the Decalogue hath a tree of Life in the midſt, a branching <hi>RECORDARE,</hi> ſtretching over both Tables: So both again compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in two Memento's of <hi>Vivere &amp; Mori,</hi> and both theſe contracted to <hi>bene vivere;</hi> two Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: The one for <hi>Praeterita;</hi> — the Pit whence hewen, the Maſs wherein corrupt; that for <hi>Erubeſcere:</hi> and then <hi>Noviſſims,</hi> leaſt the infernal Pit ſhut her mouthes upon us, and this for <hi>Contremiſcere:</hi> and ſo the Spirit and Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of all Sermons is here. For we are but Gods Remembrancers (ſo is the Holy Ghoſt too) in preaching and in Prayer. <hi>Though you know theſe things,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> yet my Duty is to put you in mind, in Remembrance; If any man be fallen, remember, and do thy firſt works: if gone back, Remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife.

However State or Church Monuments may fail a gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign (but envies ſelf cannot do ſo, — <hi>Poſt Fata quieſeit;</hi> and — <hi>Querimur</hi> then turns to <hi>Quaerimus Davidi</hi>) yet God preſerves him ever in his book of <hi>Remembrance,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>Are not theſe things noted in thy Book?</hi> by that heavenly Recorder, <hi>The righteous ſhall be had in everlaſting Remembrance.</hi>

               </gap>o men all Sermons; ſo is it if to God all Prayers. A form of Prayer for <hi>David,</hi> and all Gods

There was a right vivary indeed when the Lord of Glory, bleſſed for ever, took liſe blood of the bleſſed Virgin, our Lady.

But while he was an infant <hi>Lord</hi> in the hand of his bleſſed Virgin Mother, here he dwelt a while in his Cradle-houſe, the ſtable-cratch, then the Palace of a great King, at the ſign of the <hi>Star</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> then the right houſe of Bread, <hi>Panis Angelorum;</hi> The true Bread-houſe and true Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe (though low and little) of all his greater Houſes, his famous Churches after: at thoſe great Cities of <hi>Jeruſalem, Caeſarea, Antioch,</hi> and in good time their ſiſter <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, their little Siſter earſt, that had no breſts, but ſince ovationed for <hi>Mater &amp; Domina,</hi> as if <hi>Domus, &amp; Cultus, &amp; Dominus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been born and upbrought there <hi>ab Origine.</hi> 6. But ſtay a while! Let us obſerve <hi>Dominus &amp; Domus</hi> yet better, and we ſhall find him returned from <hi>AEgypt,</hi> abiding at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but commonly in the dwelling houſes, and banqueting houſes of his Converts; 7. Let theſe then (if I ſtaied too long at the former) ſerve briefly for two Removes of our Lord. And becauſe the

From the Preſs of people he was fain to hide himſelf in that houſe: But no houſe muſt hide or hold him long. Over the brook <hi>Cedron</hi> there was a Garden, and oft he reſorted thither, and thence betrayed, was brought from houſe to houſe; to <hi>Annas</hi> houſe, and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> to <hi>Pilats's</hi> Judgement-hall, to <hi>Heroa's,</hi> and back again to <hi>Pilate</hi>'s; ſo to his Croſs, and never reſted till the noble <hi>Joſeph</hi> laid him in his Garden-houſe, in a new Sepulchre, where never man lay; yet that the common houſe and lodging of mankind, the Grave. 9. There Kings and Counſellors of the earth build deſolate places for themſelves; lie ſtill and are at reſt (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) but ſo did not he, we know better then ſo what he did, I believe. The third day he roſe again, and aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and at that houſe we have toucht already, but yet from none of theſe houſes, not that eternal houſe of our Lord comes any comfort to us, till that Spirit of the Lord the Comforter come from him to us, to dwell in us: ſo putting us all into one houſhold of Faith, the common faith, and making us all the habitation of God by the Spirit. 10. And to make fit this houſe, this Lord the bleſſed Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was put to work it out of the rough, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to take, to break down a Partition-wall, whoſe more then <hi>Alpine</hi> rockineſs, no <hi>Hannibal</hi> but he could conquer, and no fire, no liquor but his heart blood could penetrate.

There's right <hi>Dominicum</hi> every way; The houſe of the Lord, — In the Lord, — On the Lord, — By the Lord. This houſe then in no caſe to be left out, nor we left out of it; you know who would allow us no room in their Inn at the <hi>Popes</hi> head; and by that device exclude us out of the Church, which is called a great houſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and the foundation ſtands ſure, but ſure it ſtands not all upon the cloudy Apennine.

Secondly, <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of Reſtraint, wanting thoſe Aſſiſtances which the <hi>Jews</hi> had for Recovery. 1. Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation in lively Oracles, and renewing the prime Promiſe, by Light whereof <hi>Euoch</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> found Grace to walk with God. 2. The Light enlarged in the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Seal for ſecurity, and the Promiſe affixt and pitcht upon his race, — <hi>In ſemine tuo.</hi> 3. Then the Law, a Sun of Light; yet had they Prophets too to caſt the beam by Interpretation. God dealt not ſo with any Nation. But there is a third, a wilfull and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Ignorance, ſitting down in darkneſs without Care or Endeavour to riſe up from that bondage,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107154:55"/>not improving the rational Light which was left ſtil as the Candle of the Soul. For though we find extracts of admirable Light in the Gentiles Laws, Inventions, Moral Converſation too; yet <hi>In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſione ad Deum,</hi> ſo they were Prodigals, and miſpent their portion, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> objects to the <hi>Athenians, Act.</hi> 17.26. and proves in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. that by the links and connexion of cauſes, and light of reaſon climbing up to God, yet <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, they liked it not, they liſted not to retain God in their knowledge, but wantonly and proudly abuſed the Glory of an incorruptible God, by turning it into an Image made like Beaſts and creeping things; for which ſluttiſh dealing, God gave them up to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and vile affections, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a mind devoid of Judgement, utterly dark. And whereas wanting the Jewiſh Law, they had yet the firſt draught and original wtitten in their hearts, they ſmothered this light alſo, &amp; with-held the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs; And by this darkning of themſelves, were left (ſaith the Apoſtle) without excuſe. So then here is no Light in this Darkneſs, but <hi>Abyſſus ſuper abyſſum,</hi> One degree, one veil of darkneſs upon another; yet from theſe three Regions of Darkneſs, the Reſultance may be a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple light to us; That God may be clear when he is judged, and we may receive Admonition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, For the Jews: God did for his Vine all that he could: He ſaith ſo: — many advantages, — every way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. chiefly the Oracles of God: and then adds that of <hi>David</hi> another way with <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. Secondly, For the Gentiles; however in our Saviours line of fleſh and blood, and ſo in his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual line, men made of his blood by faith (regiſtred in that Sanctiloge and Martyrologe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) we find ſome intervening of Jew and Gentile, and find beſide thoſe ſages from the Eaſt, whom by a Herald ftar he beckoned to his Birth-place, ſome ſprinkling in the Goſpel of the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-<hi>Samaritans.</hi> Yet if a maſs of them were left in darkneſs, (by wilfull ignorance) and caſt into utter darkneſs, it can be no impeachment to Divine Juſtice, becauſe firſt we are not ſure, but that the prime Promiſe of the womans ſeed to bruiſe the Serpents head, might have been preſerved among them, they being of <hi>Adams</hi> race alſo; and then we are aſſured, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. that they miſuſed that ſtock of natural abilities, in not only not glorifying God aright, but embaſing (what in them lay) the Majeſty Divine, and defiling themſelves with all abominations.</p>

A fearful evil in a double contrary reſpect; one while preſenting horror to the ſoul, fearing even where no fear is: Another while madly preſuming God as blind as they, How can he ſee through the dark cloud? Such a <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doras</hi> box is Ignorance, that in Scripture the very cover of it here, Darkneſs is made to reſemble all that's evil, vanity of mind, hardneſs of heart, Folly, Diſgrace, Diſtreſs, Trouble, Sorrow, the Grave and Hell it ſelf.

            <p n="1">
               <hi>Scruple</hi> 1. FIrſt to clear a little that Inquiry about the Gentiles Salvation, Whether it remained a Myſtery claſped up and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcloſed to the Church, both of Angels and men, till the Apoſtles time, as may ſeem by many places, by none more then the third Chapter of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle from the third to the end of the tenth verſe, where it is called a Myſtery, concealed from men; and to the Powers of Heaven then made known by the Church. The Anſwer is obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was fore-told and believed under the Law; — witneſs thoſe Promiſes and Prophecies along from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> witneſs <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmody, who plays Chriſt on his Harp, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as elegantly. And that Evengelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chiefly in <hi>cap.</hi> 9.2. and <hi>ca.</hi> 49.6. And for the Angels, though ſome deny it, yet St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and thoſe great names of learning that adhere to him, ſay certainly they knew it, for they were employed (as they conceive) to inſpire it to the Prophets. (as the Law is ſaid to be given by Angels) and the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel in that term were Angels. Whereupon the Maſter of the Sentence takes upon him to reconcile the Fathers and others
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107154:57"/>and ſaith the upper Hierarchy and moſt familiar knew before, but the lower learne it after of the Church. Once certain it is, that the plenary Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Meſſiah was not till the fulneſs of time, and to our queſtion, not till the Paſſion was conſummate, and by the Preaching Apoſtolical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late among the Gentiles.

               <hi>Scruple</hi> 2. A Second Scruple or Query is, that ſince our Saviour being nailed to his Croſs among the Jews, did afterward remove himſelf, Croſs and All to other Nations; and giving out a Commiſſion to that purpoſe, did confirm it after to <hi>Peter</hi> by a viſion from heaven: Why yet did he pronounce Salvation to be of the Jews, and ſend hit Heralds firſt to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> The anſwer is enfolded in the objection; Firſt. It was ſent to them, and beginning to preach it at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For thus <hi>Aquinas</hi> reſolves it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reaſons, 1. Chriſt and his Apoſtles were firſt to preach to the Jews, to prove the fulfilling of the Promiſes to that people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8.

So the miſſion of his Apoſtles to the Gentiles was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his paſſion; and a little before it we find in <hi>John</hi> 12.24. ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> deſired to ſee him, and he anſwers in a Riddle; <hi>If the grain of wheat die, it will bring forth much fruit,</hi> which was meant of himſelf, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> He was to die by the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then to be multiplyed in the faith of all Nations, as we ſee it come to paſs. But that faith ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10. it grows not in nature, comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</p>
            <p>And this hath brought us a little on our way in the underſtanding of our ſecond part which we now purſue, <hi>Lux in Domino.</hi> Light; That's the matter here, and the manner is <hi>in Domino;</hi> or the other way; for the matter indeed is <hi>in Domino,</hi> and the manner by way of Illumination. For what is meant? ſurely that great work of God, Mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring is meant, included in a ſecond great work, <hi>Illumination of our minds;</hi> and that in a third great work. <hi>The light of the Sun in our eyes.</hi> How rare and choice a fruit muſt that be which hath ſuch curious Coverings? The very Metaphor, or rather
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107154:58"/>Box and Neſt of Metaphors is obſervable. Is God a Metaphorical God? (ſaith one <hi>D. D.</hi>) And he anſwers himſelf, In a pious and humble meaning, reſpecting the Scriptures heights, and Excellencies in Allegories; not only ſinews in the Milk of Gods Word, and things in his Words, but ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſtrange Rhetorical paſſages, and curtains of figures flowing into figures. Where are thoſe Sophiſters, and Grand Seniors, and grave Rabbies with their old diſſembled Enſigns of Ignorance, the <hi>Beard,</hi> the Habit and the Title, that will allow men no uſe of humane Learning in diſcloſing Divine Myſteries? Is the Grape therefore harſh, becauſe ſuch Strainers cannot reach it? Theology ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the crowned Queen of Sciences, but will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her Hand-maids to carry keys to her Cabinets. But ere we look in here, be pleaſed to arreſt your conſideration on the covering of this Ark, that is, the Light of Heaven. And as before in Darkneſs, ſo here again we are blind with dazling. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the opinions of thoſe rowling Torches of Heaven, the Sun and Moon? St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and in his old age too (for it is in his <hi>Euchir, ad Lauren.</hi>) knew not whether he might account them to the Angels. And for the Light, Who ſhall tell us what it is? When it comes to our doors, and beats upon our eves, we know not whether it have a real Being in the Air, or an Intentional. The firſt, the ſecond, both, and neither of both are defended. Look into the Microcoſm, and <hi>Fiat Lux:</hi> elſe all inviſible, no form, no diſtinction, and all inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor uſe, nor beauty. 'Tis <hi>Plenitudo,</hi> the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all the Creatures, and gives them Cognition,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107154:58"/>Life, Motion. View the Microcoſm, the Light of the Body is the eye, and not the Organ ſo much as the viſive Power, the light within, that ſits behind thoſe Glaſſ-windows with a balance and a file, and weighs and works upon the ſhapes of things that enter: But both theſe Lights are Darkneſs, if the <hi>Medium</hi> be not illuminated, if the Air be dark: and ſearching the Scripture, though we find not what it is, yet we find a world of wonders in it: Five things imparted, yet remain entire; Knowledge, Vertue, Happineſs, Joy and Light, and this the Embleme of them all. No good thing but Light takes it in by compariſon; all good things, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ill, Wiſdom, Health, Beauty, Food, Joy, and Reputation: All the Graces of God, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Faith, Love, Hope, Joy, Conſolation; yea the very Glory to come; all our Joy and endleſs Bliſs in that viſion of Light. And if God ſhould ask us, What houſe we would make him, or to what compare him? Should we offend in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>LIGHT?</hi> though nothing reſemble God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, yet ſomething better ſhews how far he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all reſmblance; and by that Light his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures afford, our admiration of his Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs may be raiſed higher and higher, and with it ſo raiſed, our longing after him enlarged. And ſure as in the works of Grace, none liker God then <hi>LOVE.</hi> So in the works of Nature, Light, as it is the eldeſt, ſo the amiableſt, and the likeſt to the Father; and what the Fathers affection is to it, we may ſee by his firſt giving Light to the Chaos: It could yield him no delight (who was the double Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) ſo long as it lay in Night and Darkneſs, and ſo
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107154:59"/>deep in too, that nothing yet was day; What ſtood thus blindly, could not be pleaſing in his eye who is all eye: But when it ſaw, the Text ſaith, <hi>God ſaw that all was good.</hi> Doth he not dwell in Light, and cover himſelf with Light, as with a Garment? May we not ſay, his Houſe, and Robe, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſſence are all one boundleſs chriſtal Globe of Light? Doth not he ſay ſo? <hi>God is Light, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Father of Lights, and the Son is God of God, and Light of Light, and the Holy Spirit, as in this wide Engine of the world it is an inward eye which moves and rowls, — Spiritus in us alit.</hi> So in our Souls it is the Spirit of Illuminations, directing us to that place, <hi>where in his Light we ſhall ſee Light,</hi> even ſee God <hi>face to face, and know him, even as we are known.</hi> I had not ſtaid ſo long on this, this cover here, but that I conceived it might be in our way to diſcover what remains, remembring my Promiſe to paſs this part in explanation; ſo demonſtrating in an Orb, where every part gives Light unto one another.</p>
            <p>Here by the way might be inferred the uſefulneſs of our ſight, and how we are bound to bleſs God that enjoy that Comfort. And ſecondly, How to compaſſionate the blind that ſit in darkneſs, conſidering there is no perfect joy on earth without it, no nor in Heaven, it being one of the torments in hell, <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and contrary to the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. And thirdly, Applying to ſuch times as theſe. Rejoyce in this favour of Heaven, that earthly men cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain or exciſe the comforts of the Air and Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:107154:59"/>But we paſs to our fruit it ſelf, the meaning of this Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in our reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, veil'd here under this God-like Creature of Light: That illumination which we receive from him by his Spirit, relieving us from our ſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and bondage of darkneſs, and tranſlating us into his marvelous Light, and glorious liberty of the Sons of God, <hi>For you were,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>In Domino.</hi>

'Tis in him uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally and totally, not now Light, and now Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and exemplarily; For all Light uniformly and cauſally prae-exiſts in him, as in the ſimple and ſupernatural cauſe of all. Laſtly, In him is <hi>Light,</hi> in all the Powers of Light, <hi>Expanſion, Renovation, Nutrition, Conciliation,</hi> and in this power he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes it us; though thus to make it ours, it coſt him more then making Light at firſt; then he ſpake the Word only; but here he ſuffered, <hi>Multa tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, — Sudavit &amp; alſit.</hi> But bleſſed be the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he hath raiſed a mighty Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us in him.

This is that white Robe, which as it hath no ſpot, ſo it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no mixture in the Act and Energie of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Our merits wrought up with his, are like Musk and Ambergreece in a Perfume, faith <hi>Gomeſius,</hi> a Papiſt; and thinks he makes a fine compoſition, but is it not rather an odious compariſon? Yea, we are to renounce all thoſe devices of Congruity, Configuration, Conformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if ſuppoſed to contain any vertue in themſelves toward the Act of Juſtification; only that true <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſailing in the frail veſſel of his fleſh, comes to unrivet us from the <hi>Caucaſus</hi> of deſpair, to which mankind was faſtened by a knot inexplicable and inextricable.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107154:60"/>God is <hi>juſt,</hi> and man unrighteous, a ſinner, and muſt die, and for ſin is in darkneſs, and ſhall not ſee Light. Chriſt Jeſus ſtoops to untie this knot, denies the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, makes the ſinner righteous, juſtifies the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, makes Darkneſs Light <hi>in Domino,</hi> and then there is no <hi>Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Light is <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and that's the ſtriking the raies, not upon us only, but into us; The firſt is in him only, and ours by imputation. God in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, pleaſes himſelf in that; but this ſecond is inherent Righteouſneſs in our hearts, called <hi>Holineſs,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we ſhall never ſee nor pleaſe God. You will ſay, theſe are high and glorious ſounds, and theſe Graces with their diſtinct or united natures and times have exerciſed the wits of men, but ſince they are Donatives in the hand of our heavenly Father, How are theſe things made over to us? Clear that paſſage, make this part of your diſcourſe, this Point of <hi>Divinity</hi> lightſom to our Capacities; Tell us, how ſhall theſe things be? So ſaid the bleſſed Virgin to the Angel when ſhe was to conceive Chriſt in her body; and for this Conception, this Perception of the Lord in thy ſoul, the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer muſt ſerve, <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee!</hi> The Power of the moſt high can do this by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and how oft is that repeated <hi>Habitat?</hi> he dwells in us by his Spirit: and if any man have not the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> (thats the ſureſt mark) and a man cannot ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is therefore called the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hand of God, the vertue and Power of Chriſt, who tells us in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>I will not leave you
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107154:61"/>Orphans, I will come to you;</hi> there's his viſitation: and abide with you, there's his Reſidence and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of a Court; and adds, I will be your Teacher, Comforter, Remembrancer, and all theſe in his Spirit, who is all theſe to us, theſe are his Offices and operations. And muſt not he needs have Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at hand, that hath the God of Heaven in his heart? <hi>John</hi> lean'd upon his boſom, but Chriſt reſts in thy boſom by his Spirit, opening thy dim eyes, and opening them twice (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) giving a double Light in the Lord: Firſt to ſee thy ſin and guiltineſs, and blenching at the horror thereof, opens them again to ſee thy Saviour in his blood, and the Spirit of his Grace. But all this I have ſaid, you will ſay ſtill is meer ſpeculation. But tell us what heavenly Magick or Maſtick can combine, or which way ſhall theſe two ſpirits meet? How Gods Spirit and mans comes thus to match and marry <hi>in Domino? Quae ferramenta, &amp; qui vectes,</hi> ſaid the curious Enquirers into the Creation: And have not we ſome as curions in this Reparation? States have their <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> their <hi>Ragioni di ſtato,</hi> which is <hi>Jus Dominationis,</hi> and every Trade is called a Myſterie. But God muſt ſhew us all the jointures and Inlay of his Work and Will. Take heed of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into Light, leſt we be oppreſt with the Glory. Poor man! What diſcerneſt thou in the workings of thoſe Spirits that are but Creatures and vaſſals to the Creator? yet have their methods, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. Inventions, Circumventions, and are exalted above thy reach in high places, — have the vantage ground of Pigmee mankind: Nay, What ſeeſt thou of thy own ſpirit? Who ſaw it come in or go
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107154:61"/>forth? In the Air we all breath, in the wind that fans that air (which are but a little kin to ſpirits) what do we underſtand? yet God is ſo indulgent to our nature and weakneſs, as to take in for us auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Light of compariſon, for the clearing of that which in the downright act is indeprehenſible. Here's a ſtir indeed ſaith the poor blind-born man in <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. With what, and how, which way? Well! I cannot tell you all; but one thing I am ſure of: I was blind, born blind, and now I ſee. And our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>Thou beareſt the ſound of wind, and knoweſt it is wind by that; but knoweſt not whence, nor whither: So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> The cauſe and courſe is ſecret, but the effect diſcernable. As in Creation our ſoul and body meet by breathing, ſo here the myſtick work is Inſpiration, and infuſion of manifold graces but thoſe graces have activities, and ſuch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhall eaſily perceive that <hi>you were once dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but are now Light in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Graces then will give us further Light, whoſe excellencies are laid out in thoſe expreſſions of Water, Floods, Fountains, and Fire, and Milk, and Manna, and Oyntment, and their Efficacies in thoſe names of Seal, and Evidence, and Earneſt, and Witneſs, and Joy, and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: And are there not fruits of the Spirit? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>Fruits that grow not up from the bitter Root of corrupted nature, but from another Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and which in their bloom and freſhneſs, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man (not like thoſe Ethnick Graces, only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile and ſweet in converſation, though they do that too) but gracious in Gods aſpect, and glorious too,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107154:62"/>ſhining as a Light in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Generation. If we ſhall taft a fruit or two in ſpecialty, I will only trie to do it in this notion here, and under this Capacity of Light.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowledge,</hi> even that of nature is a Light: and mans ſoul ſtill is the Lamp of God (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) and a Wiſdom reſiding therein that Recedes as far from folly, as Light ftom Darkneſs; and this was all thoſe great Philoſophers — <hi>Animalia Gloriae</hi> had, which puft them up ſo: For this hath ſome tincture of the Serpent, and ſoon inflates; yet alas! Mans ſalvation is that Grove and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, — <hi>Nulli penetrabilis aſtro,</hi> not pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor peirceable by the ſtar-light of Reaſon. There muſt come a ſupernatural Light from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which as in the Giver, it is called a <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs, riſing with healing in his wings; the day-ſpring from on high,</hi> and <hi>the True Light:</hi> ſo in the Receiver, it is called a great and marvellous Light, of which, Will you hear St. <hi>Paul, — I count all loſs,</hi> — <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord: this indeed is all, for in this is all: <hi>This is Eternal life to know Thee, — and him whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; to know him for my Jeſus, to apprehend him for my Juſtifier by a ſecond Grace, by a true and lively Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith then is another Light of the ſanctifying Spirit, ſuperinduced on the Light of Reaſon to raiſe and perfect it; for it is not in ſtones or beaſts. God can from ſtones raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but if ſo, the work muſt firſt be done by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of a rational ſoul, and the golden Key of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107154:62"/>this Grace then fitted to the prepared wards of reaſonable Nature. It is not amiſs to compare it to <hi>Sybillaes</hi> golden bough, which grew to, and upon the Trce, and as he adds, — <hi>Auri per Ramos aura refulſit.</hi> — So this ſuperſtructure out-ſhines the utmoſt endeavours and perfections of Nature and Reaſon, and reſembled <hi>it is</hi> by ſome, as the Seal to Wax. It is not naked and meer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as Air is Fire, but Faith is rather printed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and there joined Light, (if we wilfully exſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh not their flames) will yield the bearer fair Direction, and Confidence, and Conſolation. There may be, there will be a coarctation, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this flame in the act of Faith, a damp upon the alacrity thereof; yet if there be not in us an evil heart deſirous, nay, wilfully ſet to depart from the <hi>living God: If you abide in me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour; then certainly as his Father, and he with the ſacred Spirit joyntly made <hi>Light</hi> at firſt, and pin'd it to that Sun, which was never wholly dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſince; and as he the <hi>true Light,</hi> breaking from the clouds of the bleſſed Virgins body, and joyned to mans nature, retains that nature ſtill now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: ſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this Grace poſſeſſing thy ſpirit, loves never to part again, but grieves when we offer to quench his coeleſtial fires; O then learn not to deſpair of Mercy and Aſſiſtance! Clouds and Eclipſes obſcure; and wandring and wicked thoughts, ſelf-accuſings, and ſelf-condemnings, and Satans ſuggeſtions may trouble and affright us. But if we abide in him, and be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might, and reſiſt the Devill, he will flie from us; and our hope in Chriſt;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107154:63"/>and the Power of his Reſurrection, like a riſing Morn will ſcatter all the deluſions and rebellions of the Night; and remember his gracious Promiſe, Hell-gates ſhall not prevail againſt a Faith of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence: All the Powers of Darkneſs let looſe upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he was ſafe, <hi>I know in whom I have believed. I live,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no not I, but Ckriſt lives in me;</hi> and it is his <hi>Spirit</hi> only that can give aſſurance, that whereas I was darkneſs, my Faith in him makes me light in the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for <hi>Love,</hi> another Grace, the Grace of Graces, the bond of perfection, and eſpecially of that coeleſtial Armor and Ardor of the ſoul to God: What might we ſay? Whatdo they feel, into whoſe breaſts is ſhot this right coeleſtial flame, and there ſhed abroad by the holy Ghoſt which is given them? Away then with all wanton fires of earthly Love or ambition; ſet them but by this, and they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear poor and wan, diſcolour'd, pale and drouſie things, and like meretritious females, ſhewn with modeſt and noble Matrons, daſht all out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, (for I am not too long to inſiſt on theſe Graces, ſo perceptible to the Poſſeſſors), if we would have true and laſting joy, Where ſhall we ſeek it? Is it to be found among thoſe Pangs, and Convulſions, and Palpitations of an earthly ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mind? — <hi>Mala mentis gaudia</hi> — as the heathen Poet calls them, and plac'd by him far with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Porch of hell: Meteors of imperfect mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Scanſory, and ſeeming to mine and aim at lightſomneſs, and height of Spirit: But having crackt awhile and blaz'd down, they ſlide again,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107154:63"/>and reſolve into their firſt earth and droſſineſs. But he that hath taſted of the heavenly gift, the joy in the Holy Ghoſt, wherein the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on earth doth principally conſiſt, can tell you of a joy that is full, a joy unſpeakable and glorious, conſiſting in a diſperſion of all that is dark and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and a true Light, that is, <hi>Lux in Domine,</hi> Light in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus have we trac'd this <hi>Oriens ex alto,</hi> and thus far deſcribed that Method, that <hi>Lucidus Ordo</hi> of Gods procedure in deſcent of his Spirit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Graces. Thus far we are come to meet with this great Biſhop of all our ſouls, this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Viſitor, and have obſerved his way of baptizing with the Holy Ghoſt, and with enthean fire, and confirming his People with the manifold Graces of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> But yet ſince he is in Heaven, and that <hi>Spirit</hi> is to deſcend on us, we are not ſatisfied till we know further of this <hi>Divine</hi> Method, which is the <hi>Aquaeduct,</hi> the <hi>Ventiduct,</hi> the <hi>Luciduct,</hi> which way ſtill doth Chriſt in his <hi>Spirit</hi> conveigh this Holy water, this gentle Air, this bleſſed Light to our <hi>Spirits?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs this is one of the moſt neceſſary, important, and moſt uſefull Queries we can make; and which being clearly reſolved, will ſhame both Papiſts, that hide away as much as they can, and other Hereticks that blaſpheme the Scriptures, and pretend to a Spirit enthuſiaſtick, which is nothing but the Devil of deluſion, and ſpirit of Giddineſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for our beſt Reſolve upon this queſtion, Let us do as our Saviour in the point of marriage, enquire how it was in the Beginning; Look back then to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107154:64"/>the Creation, conſider, how came Light at firſt! At firſt the Spirit moves and broods over that which is in it ſelf a confuſion, a depth, and a darkneſs; and then his mighty Word, — <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> He ſpake, and it was Light then: Then when all was dark, he made material Light; and Chriſt Jeſus is the <hi>WORD,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: For as Speech is the Image of the mind, ſo he the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, <hi>and the expreſs Image of his perſon, Heb.</hi> 1.3. The immaterial Light that was never made, and the Spirit of the true God in declaring the true Way of his Worſhip, and mans true way thereby to obtain eternal life, (as the very heathen truſted to the falſe gods, fained Oracles, which of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity muſt be revealed before man could find or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it) goes that way ſtill, that is, by the <hi>WORD.</hi> His <hi>Word,</hi> wherein is his Will revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, both makes, and is our Light. This world is Gods Book, wherein as in a Glaſs of wonders we diſcern him; but that print being Dim to us that are ſin-blind, it pleaſed him by lively Oracles to make a Mirror far more clearly revealing his mind. And as God engraved his form on his Son before all worlds, ſo what that Son is, and what the Father is to us in him, the Spirit proceeding from both, delivers in the Scriptures of both Teſtaments. And as the Sun guilds and enamels clouds and ſtreams, and hill Tops with his raies, but thruſts his own pure Light, his own living ſire through the bodies of the ſtars: ſo other Authors can but yield a faint reflexion of that beam which is direct and native in his book, where the very Law he ſtiles a flaming Light; The Prophecies — a more ſure
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107154:64"/>Word then any Eye-evidences of the Apoſtles, to which we do well to look, ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, as to a Light ſhining in a dark place, till the day dawn, &amp; the day-ſtar riſe in our hearts. But then the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel written and ſpread by his Evangeliſts, and held out by his ſpouſe the Catholick Church, is his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Light. <hi>He brought life and immortality to Light by the Goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1.10. and in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 16. <hi>I have appeared to thee</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to that choice veſſel of his Grace and name) <hi>to make thee a Miniſter,</hi> and a witneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now behold, I will ſend thee to the Gentiles; to what end? A glorious end: to open their eyes, and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, from the power of Satan unto God; and accordingly we find it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid in them that periſh, in whom the god of this world hath blinded their unfaithfull minds, that the Light of the Goſpel of the Glory of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould not ſhine unto them. And in the ſixth verſe, he ſhews the Walk and Circuit of this Light. God who commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts (there firſt) and then the caſting of the beam, to give light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. O then you have the means of Light and Grace among you Miniſters; you are the Light and Salt of the earth; and who ſhall queſtion that truth, which the Truth himſelf hath teſtified? And would it not be a very dark and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and a very flaſh and unſavory world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a publique Miniſtry of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? The Clergie, however deſpiſed, are all out
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107154:65"/>Spiritual Fathers, <hi>Propter quos hanc ſuaviſſimam Lucem aſpeximus.</hi> But yet you and they both muſt know how they have it; and the Apoſtle tells us that too in the next words,— We have this Treaſure in our earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the Power might be of God, and not of us. You are not ſent to a Means and Medicine of our preparing, or any humane, but to Gods Divine Ordinance, that which is his Power and Wiſdom to Salvation to every one that believes! And therefore this may be enough to give all humble Chriſtians ſatisfaction and acquieſcence. Speak then thy Word O Lord, <hi>and thy ſervant ſhall be healed, ſhall be undarkened;</hi> and though like <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> though ſin-blind, have my eyes opened with a word; <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.12. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake but words unto <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> but words whereby he and his houſe ſhould be ſaved, words ſo richly bleſt, that the Text ſaith, while <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake theſe words, <hi>the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word; Did not our hearts burn within us?</hi> ſaid thoſe Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. to whom our Saviour opened the Scriptures. And the Apoſtles hearers prickt at their Hearts, cried, <hi>Men and Brethren, What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> And what a large field of the Fathers teſtimonies do I here forſake to break (by your patience) into an Incloſure or two of the very Papiſts our enemies, and the enemies of the Scripture. Yet ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Gods word, even thoſe enemies being Judges; <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> himſelf is in his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, <hi>Certiſſima &amp; tutiſſima regula credendi. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de verb.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107154:65"/>omnium;</hi> 'Tis he that in a traiterous itch of wit took on him purpoſely the abuſe of Scripture, that by miſ appliance, and prophane wreſting, he might ſo abuſe our Princes, and our Church. Mark yet what he is forc'd to ſay, and ſure 'tis worth our obſervation, if I diminiſh him not in my Engliſh. There is in Scripture (ſayes he) an inviſible Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, an hidden ſplendour, a Glory unperiſhable; a wiſdom in-exhauſtible, The ſolace of humane, and the beginning of a Divine life; made by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; making our ſpirits holy, compat'd with which, the Egyptian ſages will look pale and poor; the Chaldee impure, the Grecians blockiſh, <hi>Plato</hi> no body, and Philoſophy it ſelf a fool. 'Tis the print of Heaven on earth, and if any where the Joy of Paradiſe, or at leaſt a brave Reſemblance of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light be ſhewed, 'tis in Scripture, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that is ſevered from the actual Viſion of God himſelf. Again, The paper burns me not, yet am I all inflamed in reading it. 'Tis no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, no artificial tread the Scripture uſes; yet am I drawn, and rapt to follow her, and ſhe lifts me up beyond and above my nature: ſo that I am no more mine own, but with a ſecret violence and new fire I am conſum'd and compell'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the voyce of God that ſpeaks therein. Thus far that Papiſt. But I ſpeak (I hope) to men enlightened, ſuch as prove and find in their own ſouls the power and Energy of the Divine Word both when tis read, &amp; when it is ſincerely preacht, (for I have in my Diſcourſe mingled both thoſe wayes of Gods delivering it.) And I would know of you, beloved in our Bleſſed Jeſus, did you
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107154:66"/>never in the preaching and hearing the Scriptures read, feel the Gale, the ſweet and gentle aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit paſs into your ſouls? Did the Preacher never come with darkneſs and diſconſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> anxious and perplexing thoughts, — <hi>All the day long have I ſtretcht out my hands,</hi> &amp;c. And didſt thou never meet him in the vanity of thy mind, to mock or elſe to catch and betray? And yet you both diſcern'd before you parted, a bleſsing of a good God upon you both. Both that he was ſent of God, and that the power of God was there to heal thee? <hi>Luke</hi> 5.17. And if thou haſt ſound it ſo, Take heed of quenching the Spirit — <hi>nec in te, nec in alio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas:</hi> in thy ſelf by deſpiſing, in the Preacher by diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging or diſparaging, which is all injuries in one to an ingenuous ſpirit. <hi>Rbet.</hi> 2. For the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher reduces them all to <hi>parvi-penſion.</hi> I mean not a ſmall penſion, or ſalazy for our recompence; but diſ-eſteeming, under valuing thoſe that are the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Chriſt, and Secretaries in the great affairs of his Spirit. Bethink your ſelves, could any Angel in Heaven have ſaid to man as our Lord to <hi>Peter? Feed my Lambs; my ſheep: Go, preach, baptize; whoſe ſins you retain, they are retained,</hi> &amp;c. Are theſe (ſayes one) terreſtrial ſounds? or are they uttered from the clouds above? But look not ſo high, deſcend into your own boſoms: were not you once darkneſs? are you now <hi>made light in the</hi> Lord? Which way came that Influence, was it not by the work of the Miniſtery? Thats our part; and thats the end of our ſecond part, which brings us to the third part of our Catechiſm. <hi>Gratitudo,</hi>

            <p>PAſsing the former part of the Text, I paſt you through the cloud, through Darkneſs, the Lapſe, the fall of man, the firſt part of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm: And I brought you thence to the ſecond, The Pillar of Fire, which gives Light in the night of Ignorance. <hi>Lux in Domino,</hi> the workmanſhip of God in Chriſt Jeſus; The Reſtauration: Now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only <hi>Gratitudo,</hi> Our duty. Mans obedience due to <hi>Dominus</hi> here for our Redemption, from the <hi>bondage of corruption, and reſtoring us to the glorious liberty of the ſons of God,</hi> brought from <hi>darkneſs</hi> to be <hi>light in the Lord.</hi> Which Duty is here called <hi>A Walking. Walk as children of Light,</hi> which is the third and laſt part of our Catechiſm. And it would afford a walk of many hours; I ſhall ſtrive to reduce it into one. The Stations, the Pauſes I ſhall keep are theſe. Firſt there is a <hi>Bivium</hi> (figured in the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Y) two wayes, and but two. There have been, can be, ſhall be but two wayes from the beginning to the end, and after the end of the world; for all ſhall walk in light or darkneſs, and both are in the <hi>verſe, You were darkneſs, but are light:</hi> there is the <hi>Bivium.</hi> But our way is the way of Light, and even this is of comfort by the way, that the way of Gods ſervants is a lightſome, and a delight ſome way, a clear and open paſſage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this way may be gone; For the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107154:67"/>words are the only wiſe Gods own Exhortation, and then it muſt be gone, for the words are his own commandment and our duty. Thirdly, Here are Pullies, Evidences, Inducements, three. 1. <hi>Quia Filii,</hi> becauſe Children. 2. <hi>Etiamſi,</hi> though but Children. 3. Ω's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as Children of Light, taking the Light for our example &amp; direction, and that will be double; firſt the Light of Heaven, the Sun, and then he that is our Heaven of Light, the true Light, <hi>the Way, the Truth and the Life,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. Thus far the explication, &amp; then a word of application will finiſh this walk, &amp; ſet us onward and encourage us in the way, and cauſe us to walk as Children of Light.</p>
            <p>Firſt then there is a <hi>Bivium,</hi> and both here, but the Darkneſs is paſt, the worſt is over then; For this is a way foul, and deep, and dangerous: The way, the vileſt way that ever man went. Will you hear them both briefly deſcribed, in language the beſt that ever man heard? What! mine? God forbid I ſhould mean ſo. No, not my ruſty iron: No, nor any glittering tin-ſoild enticing words of humane wiſdom, but the clear fiery tryed, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times purified ſilver of the Word of God, dictated by the holy Ghoſt: In that language we find this way and walk called <hi>Tenebrae,</hi> abſtract and plural, Darkneſs, and termed elſewhere the way of the Gentiles, their own way, after their own imaginations, in the vanity of their mind; inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately walking as men, <hi>i. e</hi> as meer men, according to the courſe of this world, in craſtineſs, in the hidden thing; of diſhoneſty, after the fleſh, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs, luſts, uncleanneſs, exceſs, riot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the prince of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107154:67"/>of the Air, the ſpirit that works in the Children of diſobedience; till the paths of their ways (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) come to nothing and periſh; till they arrive at the iſſues of death (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi>) and all their Foundations, Plots, Projects, Hopes, Aims, be out of courſe (ſaith <hi>David,</hi>) going on ſo long, and departing from God, till he be forced to ſay, <hi>Depart for ever, Go ye curſed,</hi> and ſo ends that walk; O no! well were it for them if it might end, but it never ends; for this dark and ſlippery way ſlips them into Hell, and that Gulf enlarges her ſelf, that horrible pit opens her mouth wide upon them, from whence there is no Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, but they ſhut out from the Father of Lights, reſerved in endleſs chains of Darkneſs to abide eternal eternal Damnation. Methinks I hear you now upon that Reſpond in the Litany, From thy wrath, and from everlaſting damnation, <hi>good Lord deliver us.</hi> The good Lord hath and doth, and will deliver us, if we will be delivered. If we will but walk the other, the better way, the way of <hi>Light,</hi> which elſewhere is called the <hi>good old way, Jer.</hi> 8. The way of old <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham;</hi> a walking with, and before, and after God in his Laws, Statutes, Ordinances, cleaving to the Lord with all the ſoul. A walking in liberty and ſafety over Lions &amp; Dragons, through Darkneſs, through the valley of the ſhadow of death. A people walking humbly with their God, and God going along with his people in the Light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and bleſſing in the midſt of their Camp, Tents, Tabernacles. And in the New Teſtament it is called a <hi>following of God,</hi> of him who is the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107154:68"/>Light; a walking worthy of the Lord, worthy their vocation, circumſpectly, wiſely, honeſtly, orderly, in Truth, in Love, in Knowledge, in good works, in newneſs of life, in the fear of the Lord, and in comfort of the holy Ghoſt. And in this Church Chriſt walks amidſt the ſeven golden Candelſticks, and this Church ſhall walk with him in <hi>Albis,</hi> in white ſtoles, when all believing Nations ſhall walk in the light of the new <hi>Jeruſalem. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I have ſet before you light and darkneſs, the good and the evil way; but chuſe the good, eſchew the evil, and walk as Children of Light.</hi> For firſt,</p>
            <p>We may do ſo, for the words are an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the Wiſdom of God exhorts to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impoſsible. No impoſing upon his creature, without a previous diſpoſing. He enforms us of no Duty, but he gives means of performance. We ſhall have a portion; the danger is our running away from our heavenly Father, and waſting our whole ſtock. We ſhall not want Grace to help us in time of need, if we receive it not in vain, if we abuſe it not, if we turn not his Grace into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He invites us to a race, who aſſiſts us alſo in the running, and cals to us to caſt off all that may hinder us. And if he lay any thing upon us, firſt he promiſes it ſhall be no more then he enables us to bear, and then bids us caſt our care upon him, <hi>for he cares for us,</hi> and he carries for us, hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the moſt inſupportable burden, bore all our ſins in his body on the tree, that we might be at perfect liberty both in body and ſoul. And if the Son ſo make us free, then are we free indeed; and being thus at this liberty by Chriſt, we may well go
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107154:68"/>on our way preſcribed, having our hearts enlarged; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, I may go, nay I can walk thy ways O Lord: yea then I will run the wayes of thy Commandments. And ſurely till then, till the ripe ſeaſon God doth not call upon men; for mark the exhortation here, and you ſhall ſee it leans back, and liſtens to the words before, and is like a pair of Compaſſes, of which, though one foot ſtand ſtifly here on <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. — Now walk as the palſie-bed rid man, now, and not till now, not till healed in caſe to walk. When you were darkneſs, you could not ſee to walk as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light; then you ſaw not, you regarded not God, and that time of your ignorance God overſaw too. He regarded it not, but now under the Goſpel Diſpenſations, he will have all men to come to Repentance and knowledge of the Truth. In corrupt nature mankind lay as in fetters and manicles on hands and feet, like St. <hi>Peter</hi> bound with two chains; but if an Angel of Grace come down with a Light into the priſon, then <hi>Peter</hi> will up, and follow the direction of that Light, then he will, when his Irons are knockt off, and then ſhall nothing hinder him; then the Iron gate flies openof its own accord; ſtrong prevalent luſts, to which he hath been lockt and wedlockt; and that Iron ſinew in his ſoul, that rock of Adamant ſhall diſſolve and break into a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107154:69"/>bitter-ſweet flood of Repentant tears. Such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage may we make of this little Particle <hi>Now,</hi> now we have got it into the heart of the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is Gods Will ever, now walk, now or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; to day while it is called to <hi>day,</hi> leſt hereafter you have no more dayes. And now while it is this inſtant <hi>Now,</hi> leſt we never have another Now; Now while we are called upon, labor and pluck up our feeble knees, and give all diligence to make our calling (begin there,) and ſo our Election ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. and ſo is St. <hi>Paul</hi> here and elſewhere to be underſtood. While you have time, and light, and free Grace offered in the Word of Grace; Now when called to labor in the Vineyard; O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay not; have a care of your precious ſouls, and work out your ſalvation with ſear and trembling, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we may, let us do this work, nay we muſt; for the words are Imperative mood as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tenſe, and none exempted; they are in the plural number too. And though the verb be of the active voice, yet it implies our whole duty, what we juſtiy own to Chriſt our Saviour, which is both an active and paſſive obedience. Active firſt: And in that is firſt to be conſidered action imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent within the heart, devotion there upon that Altar, thats moſt acceptable to God who is the <hi>Father of ſpirits,</hi> John 4. <hi>ſeeks ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> I will marry her, and ſpeak unto her heart, ſaith Chriſt by the Prophet to his Church, his Spouſe, and betwixt ſpouſed Pairs the offices are mutual. God ſanctifies your hearts by his Spirit, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit calls upon you in his Word. Sanctifie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107154:69"/>you the Lord God in your hearts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. We are renewed, and purified, and dreſt by him habitually: But in uſe of his Graces, in acts of Faith, and Repentance, and Obedience, we muſt be dayly renewing and purifying, like the ſpunging of a Statue, or trimming of an Armor, (it is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of Light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) though done yeſterday, yet muſt be done to day again, and in this ſenſe we muſt be carefull for to morrow too. Secondly, In Actions tranſient, <hi>for we are his workmanſhip, Eph.</hi> 2.10. What then? we to do nothing for our ſelves? Yes, that follows in due place and time, — His work-manſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus, — To what? unto good works which he hath ordained, that we, we ſhould walk in them. For whether that of <hi>Cajetan</hi> be exactly true or no, that infuſed habits are of the ſame nature with acquiſite; Thus far it is true, that both are preſerved and maintained by works and action. Haſt thou Faith? ſhew it: Let your Light ſo ſhine; and God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified when his Children of Light are ſeen walking in Love. All vain pretences then, — <hi>Et utinam hoc eſſet, — &amp; bene latuit, — &amp; fallentis ſemita vita;</hi> and ſo the monkiſh ſolitude, with their <hi>Mors pretioſae</hi> are here all together ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of this walk: and likewiſe the proud and painted Phariſee, the ſwelling ſeeming Juſticiary, which ſect repuliulates, and comes up thick in every ſucceſſive Generation. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaw a brood of them, pure in their own eyes, yet moſt impure: of a ſtrange alloy and medley, religious and wicked. And thoſe of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> order, he confeſſes, to be <hi>Zealots,</hi> very ſtrict in appearance, faſt twice a week,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107154:70"/>tythe all I poſſeſs. This was well, he ought to do ſo; But Chriſt that ſaw his root was vain glory, brings him on the ſtage for our learning to play his part of <hi>Miles glorioſus,</hi> with a Panegyrick of his own praiſes in his prayer, <hi>With Lord, I thank thee that I am not like other men.</hi> But all ſuch flaring Hypocrites are met with by St. <hi>James, Thou haſt faith, ſo hath the Devil,</hi> ſaith he: Is that faith, which is all words and no works? Can that Faith ſave thee? Or is it <hi>vera fides?</hi> Very faith indeed? No, it is the other <hi>Fiàes</hi> rather, that is a very Fiddleſtring. Saith not St. <hi>Paul</hi> as much? Sever it from works of Charity, and it is a meer ſound, and an ungracious ſound too, <hi>A ſounding braſs or a tinkling Cymbal.</hi> Again they are met with by this Apoſtle, where expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Text, he tells them and us, that walking in Light, is all one with walking honeſtly. Now is there any honor whence honeſty is derided? Is it not a ſhame? Is this to deal fairly? Is it fit men ſhould ſo miſ-uſe God and Godlineſs? What? make a ſhew of Godlineſs, and have nothing to ſhew for it, when it comes to the proof? If nothing but profeſs, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I ſhall be even with you one day.</hi> Now its your day to appear goodly and glorious before deluded men, and to be thought Saints. But when I come to be made manifeſt in my true and real Saints, and to glorifie them indeed, then I'le profeſs too; I'le profeſs to you, I know you not, I know you well enough from the heart root; but to be the men you call your ſelves, My Saints, my Elect and choice ſervants, for ſuch I know you not, <hi>Depart from me,</hi> you have been Retainers and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to, and talkers of piety, but workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:107154:70"/>2. So far of active, now for paſſive obedience. A Chriſtian ought to be ſuch a one as old Philoſophy and Poetry did Ideate only and imagine, — <hi>Sibi imperioſus, &amp; totus teres atque rotundus:</hi> A kind of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> mingled, not only to do, but ſuffer nobly. For which end, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> made men believe they had no infirmities, but had turned out all their Paſſions and affections, which is impoſsible. Nor is that the thing which God requires; 'Tis not a diſparking, a disforeſting, but a Cicuration, a Subjugation, a Captivity, a Crucifixion, a Mortification; and then farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Chriſtian profeſſion, Walking here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a bold and conſtant courſe both in our faith, and in our obedience, the life and ſoul of faith; a courſe undaunted, an Eagles flight, bold and forth on.

Can they ſhew me from all that ſtory a pair of worthy courages (unleſs they will alledge thoſe mercenary Fencers) embrandled and fighting a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell for the Lye, or the ſon of a whore, or any ſuch poor froath as flies from men in wrath, or vext with diſtemper in drink or play? But I am preaching to ſober Chriſtians a Religion that never occaſions, much leſs neceſsitates any Diſciple to a fact which muſt inevitably draw on, or endanger their hanging, or damning, or both. And have we ſo learned Chriſt? Did not that Lord and King of Glory empty himſelf firſt of all his Glory, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no Reputation, and then endured ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of ſinners, ſuch cruel mockings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings? How many falſe accuſations bore He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107154:71"/>he bore his Croſs? So what a Tullying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of <hi>Tertullus!</hi> What Rattles, and Drums, and Gun-ſhot! And what a Catalogue of ſufferings paſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> before he could finiſh his courſe, and attain the Crown of Righteouſneſs? and even in the ſhock of painfull afflictions a man of God endued with a true Chriſtian fortitude and Patience, will learn to take up his Croſs, and learn by it as a a ſound Diſtinction, and take it as Gods uſefull Fan to unmingle him from the chaffie and feathery things of the world; and will look through it, and find Gods primary intention of Mercy in ſending it. So <hi>David,</hi> the man after Gods own heart, did expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment his afflictions to be good for him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of him into a right way. And ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive walk was his clean through; In his beginning, the Bear, the Lion, the uncircumciſed Philiſtine; then Troops of enemies with arrows, and arrows prepared, ſhot, and ſhot privily. Coſt, and Care, and Wit employed to ruine him: yet he ſings, <hi>The Lord is my Light and my Salvation, whom then ſhall I fear?</hi> Nay, ſo far from fearing, that if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, it belongs to us to look for croſſes. What ſon is it whom the Father chaſtens not? It is the lot of all his genuine Children, it is the walk of all his paſture-ſheep. In the ſheep-walk comes the ſtorm, the Shearer, the Butcher; Why? <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all the day long, and counted as ſheep to the ſlaughter.</hi> If it come to death for Chriſt or his Cauſe, it is the higheſt dignification to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, next his own aſſuming it, that parting with life is the conſummate, the beſt part of thy walk; that ſevering is Union, and that diſſolution make; the knot indiſſoluble.</p>

So it is not improper, if we take the Light here for Chriſt the ſecond perſon; for he being the Wiſdom of God, is his Son from all Eternity, and yet a joint-Parent; as <hi>Eve</hi> is <hi>Adams</hi> daughter, and yet trne mother of all that call him <hi>Father.</hi> Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then is our filial obedience, in Faith, in Fear, in Love, as dutifull Children, elſe the Heathen will ſhame the Chriſtian with his Morals; and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the Practicks is but moral vertue expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. There is by it no third part added to our ſoul and body; The Dr. of Heaven tels us he came <hi>adimplere,</hi> to fill up the Law by ſupply, where it was too narrow in the precepts. And therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and enlargement being his, it ſhould excite and enlarge our obedience, ſpecially conſidering whom we call Father, the ſame is our Lord here; And ſhall the Creatutes ſhame us? The Sun will ſtand ſtill, or back his fierie ſteeds, as in the time of <hi>Joſhuab</hi> and <hi>Ezekiah;</hi> the ſtormy Winds and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts fulfilling his Word. And is it enough for us to take that name into our mouths, to crie only, <hi>Lord, Lord.

And this puts us in mind of our Fathers preſence, and of our due obſervance in this place; a ſubject to a proclamation, though it be but to fill his head, will uſe a reverent geſture; A Son will addreſs and prepare for his Fathers preſence, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if then and there to ask his bleſſing; more if he

Learning of the Sun, which is not retrograde for winds or clouds, nor weary of his luminous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after ſo many thouſand years of Circuit, ſets him not down, but moves ſtill in a circular, in a coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial and communicable motion; which motion if any dare traduce, and call it a <hi>Pad-way,</hi> ot diſpute it into terms of falſe, inconſtant or ſerpentine, as they uſe the Sun; let the <hi>Perſian</hi> or the <hi>Indian</hi> adore or curſe; ſo let the unclean worldings, or churliſh hel-hounds bark, the child of Light will like the Sun, cut a clear paſſage through all, and ſmiling, riſe from out the liquid ſnares and jaws of gyant clouds unhurt, uncaught, and like a Sun-beam (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) though forced to ſhine on dung hils, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with baſe and wicked company, — yet comes off untainted, <hi>Et hoeret origini ſuae,</hi> ſtill cleaves inſeparably to the firſt ſpring of Light.</p>

But Sermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learning is not all, there is another Knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in points of neceſſary controverſie, (for there is a maſs of ſuperfluous ones) when we go out againſt him we call the common enemy; And who ſhall then afford us a ſmart ſling and poliſht ſtones, or make us that ſtuff which may fell the Philiſtine, and choak the Dragon of Superſtition? And bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, even from the firſt Reformation we had ſome Chieſs in our Church, clear and able Lights; who ſome of them in the Marian dayes, were uſed like the Chriſtians in <hi>Neronian</hi> nights, who were lapt in pitch and roſin to make high-way Torches, and ſuch as the Papiſts would not believe to be Lights, till they ſaw them on a light fire. And among their modern Succeſſors, may we not ſhew ſome learned and laborious works publiſht in the eyes and defiance of our Adverſaries Tenets? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that late volumn of Diſſertation, with a grand and prime <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> concerning thoſe great points of Councils erring, and the laſt Reſolution of Faith,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107154:77"/>and the Popes Inſallibility, wrttten with puiſſance and clearneſs, ſuch as the Chriſtian world will hardly match it.

And I can ſhow you here another great Defender or our Churches Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that hath ſo diſimpoſtered the grand couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and ſo be-headed their Head, ſo layed low their Supremacy, and then (like another <hi>Ehud</hi>) hath ſo daggered himſelf into that <hi>Eglon,</hi> the fat beily of their Maſs, that he hath left them neither Head nor ſtomack to anſwer him.</p>
            <p>My next Application is to our lives; We ſhould be ſtars, thickeſt parts of Spheres, not dulleſt, but abler and better compact. And ſurely if our Converſation be not <hi>Lux in Domino,</hi> our Learning and natnral Parts will prove but <hi>Auctoramentum,</hi> and <hi>Preſſe mony</hi> to Implety, and <hi>culpa ſuaſoria,</hi> as <hi>Amb.</hi> ſpeakes. I know the <hi>Vulgus malignum</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nor Life, nor Learning in a Miniter, ſo he be ſome ſilly Neophyte, or poor fellow whom they may feed quarterly, and rule, and laugh at when they liſt, or elſe ſome jovial and bone companion.</p>
            <p>And I know there is a cloud of ſowr Criticks that will of force have all the motions of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy come in and cloſe on perfect Circles, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to us one ſpiral line, or any the leaft encentrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But my monition preſſes no further then to a pious and watchfull behaviour, remembring we are <hi>Lux in Domino,</hi> and to our Lord accountable: That
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107154:77"/>when he ſhall Re-appear, we may hear him ſay, not ſo much well ſaid, or O well preacht, (though that would be well too) <hi>But Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant, enter thou into thy Maſters joy.</hi>

            <p>And now to ſpread this exhortation, and take in all the Aſſembly, all our proceedings muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, like the Light riſing, and ſetting in a courſe that is orderly. The Subject of the Canon Law, is <hi>Homo dirigibilis in Deum &amp; bonum commune.</hi> And as order helps in Civil Converſation, ſo is it prevalent in our way and walk of Religion too.

            <p>There is another application, which (though I have been long) I dare not leave out, it is ſo tyed to the Text, and follows at the eleventh <hi>verſe, Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but even reprove them rather.</hi> I may not ſtay to reprove
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107154:78"/>them. Suffer me to name a work or two of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Ile commend you all to the Father of Lights.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sacrilegious Simony betwixt a lay-man and a Clerk; It is a vice of wickedneſs, that like Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tety defiles two perſons at once: and like Adultery is a work of Darkneſs If one ſee them, they are in the terrours of the ſhadow of Death; <hi>Deprendi mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerum.</hi> And therefore this bargain is ever driven in the dark; And like a piece of conjuring they get both within a circle, and have their ſpels and charms for ſecreſie. You ſhall ſwear never to reveal what I payed, and I will be drawn in pieces ere I tell, how many ſcore, how many huudred pieces: But my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron when gone aſide, he boaſteth, and cannot chuſe but tell his Lady perchance what fine things theſe preſentations are? ſell my land, and it never comes again; that cruel word <hi>Ses heires.</hi> But the Dunce or drunkard that bought, may be forced to ſell again, or elſe reſign, or chop, or be put out, or dye, and then there's more money. <hi>Thy money periſh with thee.</hi> Thou, what ſhall I call thee? Be what thou wilt, and quarter what coats thou canſt, thy great Anceſtors name was <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> Well, is that the worſt? No, Remember what St. <hi>Peser</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ananias, why hath Sa'an filled thy heart?</hi> and who it was that entered into the heart of <hi>Judas,</hi> when he went to betray and ſell his Mafter: thou ſelleſt thy Maſter and thy Maſters Patrimony, <hi>Patrimonium crucifixi,</hi> The Patrimony of Chriſt crucified, ſo it is called. Tuſh <hi>caveat emptor.</hi> You of the Clergy are the <hi>Magus's,</hi> tis true: and where's the Purchaſer too going to ſwear? a dreadful ſwearing! And haſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107154:78"/>thou done it? What, <hi>Ne<expan>

But <hi>quis talis fando, &amp; quis tam ferreus! — &amp; hec dici potuiſſe, &amp; non potuiſſe refelli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Oppreſſion is a work of Darkneſs, though practiſed openly, in extorting Oſſicers, and ſuch men as greedy of Gain intrench and encloſe themſelves from others, and hurl out the poor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, turn them a walking, to enlarge their ſheep-walks. Do theſe men walk honeſtly, and as <hi>children of light?</hi> And is there not a Brood and flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Prodigals that tend to oppreſſion too? Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Gull-Gallants, that like <hi>NERO</hi> at firſt lap up horſes, houſes and Lands into Balls, and throw them away in Dole and Lottery, till they come to a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery. So long miſ-demeaning themſelves, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing and flying out, till it come to a cruel miſſing of their Demeſnes in the end; and then are forced to skrew, and rack, and grind the ſaces and bowels of the poor, with <hi>Neroes</hi> reſolution too, <hi>Hoc aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ne quis quicquam habeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Drunkenneſs had wont to be a work of Darkneſs; But now it defies the harbour of duil night, and dares look day in the face. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file meets them terribly, both the <hi>Extortioner,</hi> and the <hi>Drunkard:</hi> Neither of them ſhall <hi>inberite the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly and laftly, That deſperate and indeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſin of ſwearing; when the ſoul is let go for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. No profit, no pleaſure, unleſs hell and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting darkneſs dwell in mens deſires. But I forgee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107154:79"/>the time; and I hope for better things of you, and ſnch as accompany ſalvation. And I truſt I ſhall fitly and ſully apply the Text to all that are here; and in the Repetition of theſe words take in all the Congregation, <hi>&amp; poſtremo meipſum.</hi> Beloved, <hi>we wers once darkneſs, are now light in the Lord. Let us then walk as children of light.</hi> Which that we may do, let us pray to the Father of Lights; <hi>Almighty God, give us grace to caſt away the works of darkneſs, and put on the Armour of Light,</hi> &amp;c,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hich words afford a double Priviledge of Gods ſervants (be the times what they will) in Reference to their owner deſcribed by his high and ſtately ſtile of <hi>Dominus Exercituum.</hi> Firſt, his own they are, his peculiar. Secondly, eſteem'd of him at a high rate, for they <hi>are his Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</hi> The firſt priviledge is laid out in this plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; They that in a Deluge of corruption (ſuch as covered all in time of this Propheſie) are yet
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107154:80"/>emergent and bear up againſt the ſtream: They that in deſperate and deſolate times dare yet make proof that they fear this Lord of Hofts, and think upon his Name, they are Gods own, his peculiar. For ſo the Rabbins interpret this word <hi>Segullah</hi> by <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, peculiare, proprium ſpeciale, praecipuum, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulare.</hi> God hath a propriety, a ſpecialty in them. I conceive your thoughts and expectations have by this time call'd me off from this ſeeming dry tree: for what fruit ſhall you or I gather hence, in being Gods own and of his peculiar people? But I am even for this Imaginations ſake deſirous to inſiſt; and ſo far to intreat your patience too, that I may yet be reſident, that I may ſpend the hour wholly incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on this little thing, as it may ſeem of mine, which yet in opening will appear I doubt not a rich and an inexhauſtible Mine of Treaſure, and ſuch as will prove uſeful and appliable to every Hearer. You may then miſtake, you may prejudice me: you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what work God may be pleaſed to enable me to make of this Text before, and when I come to reſreſh the honour and comfort of my liſe in preaching again in this Audience. Now I mean not to part with this my firſt part, in the Royalty, the Prieſthood and peculiarity of Gods people (capable of that former Deſcription) which is compriz'd in this claim, and promiſe and aſſurance (for it is all thoſe) <hi>And they ſhall be mine,</hi> ſayes the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To every Text belongs but explication and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; I intend both. In the explication firſt, that is now the opening, that is the working of this Mine, I ſhall preſent you with the riches of the Ore, and then the refined Gold; or draw firſt ſome materials
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107154:80"/>from the Mine wherewith to build our comfort, and then ſuper-induce a roof and crown of pure Gold, in precious things in Chriſt, under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was under the old too, but not ſo clear, ſo compleat, <hi>Where God in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> weares the crown of Mercy mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and enwraps us in a Robe of <hi>Totius;</hi> total con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation by uniting us with the bonds of his Love, by a plenteous Redemption, <hi>made not with corruptible things as ſilver and gold, but with the blood of Jeſus the Lamb of God who takes away the ſin of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt material from this Mine may be the very ſtrowing of ſome grains of Golden comfort in our enterance on the conſideration of Gods Word, and work with man. Tis a ſpecial hightning of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a mighty complacency and ſatisfaction to a ſervant of God, to believe that God is, and <hi>that he is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb 11. for even <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to have had this in his aym, he had an <hi>eye to the recompence of Reward; David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his firſt <hi>Pſalm</hi> (where he deſcribes Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) with <hi>Beatus. Bleſſedneſs</hi> is a bleſſed pully to Devotion; and therefore both the Day-ſtar, and the Sun take this courſe: both the Baptiſt &amp; Chriſt Jeſus come preaching the Kingdom of Heaven upon our converſion to God. It is obſervable, that as God hath bound himſelf to a perpetual Revolution of Winter and Summer; that Spring and Harveſt in <hi>Autumn</hi> ſhall never fail. So his whole will &amp; Word is a miſcellany of Law and Goſpel; and ſuch light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and comfortable Texts as this found in <hi>Iſay</hi> many, and in <hi>David</hi> many, very many Evidences Evangelical; and we in that reſpect to attend this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107154:81"/>hour to the Goſpel of St. <hi>Malachy: For not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God,</hi> not the leaſt or laſt but hath an Inlay of mercy wrought up with Judgement and ſweet and gracious Promiſes mingled with comminations. They bring us down to diſcontent by the waters of <hi>Marab</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> to bitter <hi>weeping in the Valley of Tears;</hi> to perſecution of a <hi>red Sea,</hi> the <hi>biting of fiery ſerpents,</hi> and a killing letter of the Law: But they leave us not without diſcovery of a <hi>Brazen ſerpent</hi> to cure us; and many precious aſſurances, that God <hi>will put all our tears in his bottle, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> away all tears from our eyes:</hi> That he <hi>will take us out of many waters,</hi> and <hi>bring his own again from the deep of the ſea,</hi> and revive us by the <hi>glad tidings of the Goſpel of Peace and Reconciliation.</hi> And experimentally Gods ſervants ſhall find it ſo in his actual dealing with them, that look how God hath not left <hi>himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſs</hi> in his general Providence ſhowring down on earth his balmy Influences from Heaven; ſo in his ſecret impartments of <hi>hidden Manna,</hi> and in his open appliances to his holy Ones in thoſe celeſtial dews of mercy, which ſall only on the fleeces of his Paſture-ſheep, when tis dry upon all the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, we find this exemplified in the head of his Church, who as in himſelf he <hi>is a Light ſhining in darkneſs, ſo as the darkneſs comprehends it not;</hi> ſo his whole life and death was like light in a Lanthorn, or lightnings from ſummer clouds, pauſes of ſorrow and dejection with various glimpſes and coruſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his glory mixt and interweav'd. For crucified dead and buried, our Creed aſſiſts us with a glorious Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and Exaltation of that ſame crucified dead and buried Lord and Saviour
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107154:81"/>Chriſt Jeſus. So to preſent you with ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his myſtical Body, in their interchangeable Robes of ſackcloth and tiſſue; their Coronets of thornes and Roſes, were an eaſie task; I name but two, the <hi>Father of the faithful,</hi> and the <hi>man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods own heart:</hi> whom one while we find in fear, horrour and great darkneſs and an horrible dread hath overwhelmed them; another while rejoycing in hope and aſſurance of Gods All-ſufficiency, and with hearts dancing for joy, as that ſweet ſinger expreſſes it: and how could I make this truth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious but without a ſailing over to the prime Apoſtles in the New Teſtament? which I purpoſely reſerve for a new and latter diſcovery, when we come to cloſe with the conſummation of this Conſolation; mean time in this very firſt opening of the Mine, you ſee enough diſcovered to conſute ſuch as think there is no Golden Vine nor branch of comfort in Gods ſervice; but ſeduced by Satan pretend an inequality, a rugged unevenneſs in the wayes of God, which God himſelf diſclaims, and imputes it to our wayes. It is not the Religion of God that is unprofitable or vain, as thoſe fooliſh people in this Chapter openly profeſs'd, nor does his ſervice incline men inevitably to ſadneſs and melancholy.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Material from this Mine is the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and combination of this comfort, in that God chains this mercy to a preceding mercy; He begins here with a conjunction— <hi>and they ſhall be mine,</hi> — and then couples it to a ſucceeding mercy, — <hi>and I will ſpare them,</hi> &amp;c. Comfort paſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come: Many feathers of Gods Wing: many ſhowers of <hi>Manna</hi> and of <hi>Quailes:</hi> The
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107154:82"/>whole ſrame and pile of comfort from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſixteenth to the end of the ſeventeenth <hi>ver</hi> is pitcht as a Tabernacle of Joy with courtains &amp; coverings, with loops and taches of conſolations in conjunction; God is and ever was a God of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and communion; a God of Order and combination. Diſcord and diſ-union are from the Devil: God in Eſſence from before all beginning was unſolitary. God that in wiſdom ſaw it was not fit for man to be alone, in his wiſdom ſaw it was not good for God to be alone. He is God alone, that is, there is no other: But <hi>I am not alone,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, never was ſo, that is, without the Father and the Holy Ghoſt. All the three bleſſed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons as co-eſſential, ſo co-eternal and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, which makes for us; we better apprehend, and better apply God in the Trinity of perſons; ſo branching and reaching out more fruit to us, then the contemplation of the Unity; And as in Eſſence, ſo in works of God, which reſpecting us externally, are all co-operations of all three Perſons: we find in nature firſt, all things produc'd in number, weight and meaſure, and all things in connexion ſtill. One <hi>brother holds another by the heel,</hi> and as our eyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapt in ſeveral tunicles, each under other, ſo are thoſe films and skins of ſphears imaginary, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the vaultages, and enwombings, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapings, and ſwathings of the conſtellations and coverings ore thoſe conjoyned Elements, which are lodg'd in one anothers laps, and inlaid and mortiſ'd into one anothers boſomes. And ſo in his mornings and evenings dole and diſtribution; in his daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Diſpenſation, all is done in order, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107154:82"/>by a ſet conjuncture of his Officers. The Heavens appointed to <hi>hear the earth,</hi> the <hi>earth to hear the corn, and wine and oyl, and they to hear us,</hi> Hoſ. 2.22. Such a chain of cauſes in things natural, while the Cauſe of cauſes, and the God of all theſe conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, hath the upmoſt link faſtened to his Divine will in heaven; But all the Links let down are wrapt about his beloved creature man, in mercies that compaſs him round, and embrace him on every ſide: In midſt whereof guarded by Angels that <hi>pitcht their tents about him,</hi> man takes Repoſe and ſleeps to the muſick of the hollow murmuring winds and waters, which ſeem to whiſper in his <hi>ears a memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> of his ſervice to that Lord for whoſe ſake they are yet in ſervice to man. But ſecondly, in works of Grace is God obſervable to be a God of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. In his firſt gracing of his choſen <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to enable them for a great and wiſe people, he <hi>gave them a Law from heaven,</hi> Deut. 4.6. which was a Law conjunctive, both affirmative, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength: and thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Two tables joynd by Gods own hands, and a Rejoinder by our Saviour. <hi>This is the firſt and great Commandement, and the ſecond is like unto it:</hi> keep both, or neither. <hi>he that fails in any one, is guilty of all:</hi> and alſo Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, <hi>Dew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus far the Materials of comfort drawn from this Mine, both in the radiant mixture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, and expanſion of thoſe diffuſive joyes, whoſe nature is to ſupple and ſuſtain them in adverſity; and all this again complicated and arreſted upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and proof of their Lords being <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Exercituum.</hi> And now laſtly, (to keep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) I ſhall trie to ſuperinduce a Roof and Crown of pure Gold over all theſe Materials, which is the Conſummation of the Saints Conſolation, as God becomes ours, and we His, in the only Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus: which before we can well diſcern, it is requiſite we diſcover to the bottom of this Mine, and find the firſt foundation of Gods people laid upon the only love of God, in making choice of them at firſt for his Peculiar: For to be his in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is the common lot of all his Creatures; <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> Again, <hi>His delight was ever with the ſons of men, Acts</hi> 17. and he made of one blood all mankind to dwell on all the face of the earth: All live and move, and are in Him and His Off-ſpring and Generation; and he provides for all Light, and Influences, and ſhowers of fatning rain, to fill their hearts with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107154:86"/>food and gladneſs. But in <hi>Exodus</hi> 19.5. where we find this very word in the Text, denoting <hi>Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity</hi> and <hi>Choiceneſs,</hi> God tells his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he had derived from <hi>Abraham, the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> that if they would <hi>obey his words</hi> indeed, and <hi>keep his Covenant,</hi> then they ſhould be a peculiar <hi>Treaſure</hi> to him above all people; For all the earth (ſaith God) is mine; but not ſo mine as You: for he goes on, <hi>You ſhall be a kingdom of Prieſts, and an holy Nation.</hi> Only the Lord there laies down the <hi>Corner-ſtone</hi> of this building, and diſcovers the bottom reaſon of his electing them, which was not ſaith he your multitude, for you were the feweſt, nor your inclination to my ſervice, for you were an obſtinate and ſtiff-necked people: but only he had a delight in their Fathers, (ſo we have it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.) to love them above all people. Which love of God, as it drew on his firſt calling them, ſo it occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his preſerving them from all the world, when planting this Vine in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (where it was pincht and ſtraitned) he made room for it, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted it to grow and flouriſh in the vaſt and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Wilderneſs, and on the ſandy botome of the ſea, till removing Nations greater and mightier then they, he made that people poſſeſs the gates of their enemies, and his Bleſſings and Protections ſtill eminent, and imminent; ſtill over their heads, even then when they provoke him to ſend them into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, from whence yet he gathered them again; and as that daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> that Church through the four Monarchies, ſo after he had joined and made up a Church of Jews and Gentiles, he bleſt and preſerved it through the ten Perſecutions, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107154:87"/>to this very day; For now we are refining this Gold, and extending this propriety of God in his Saints and ſervants under the new Teſtament, as we have cauſe to do; we that live ſince that fulneſs of time which delivered him to the world, in whom it pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell. Then cartainly this conſideration of our being Gods Peculiar in Chriſt, <hi>the Sen of his love,</hi> will riſe to a full conſolation: For in him we know the Covenant was renewed, and ſealed in his ſacred blood, whereby thoſe great Rivers of Creation and Providence flow over, and fall into the large ſea of Redemption; and by that ſea we may ſail fairly on to the fair havens of Sanctification, and compaſſing the point of good hope, of a true and lively hope, arrive in the end at endleſs Glory; All this will be done, if once we be his own in him, that is, his only Beloved: if once he admits us into the league, make us Confiederates and Princes of the Union, <hi>Kings unto God by his blood, Rev.</hi> 1.7. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis is upon <hi>His,</hi> for that blood of his, that Unction, that Inauguration will effect it. <hi>He</hi> and <hi>They,</hi> God and Man at diſtance, at enmity before, by him who is both God and man, and ſo a fit <hi>Modus</hi> and <hi>Medium,</hi> and a fit Mediator, are reconciled. God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. No wonder, though this be not only called a grand Myſterie, as it is conſiderable in the perſon of Chriſt alone, God manifeſted in the fleſh, that God ſhould be made our very fleſh; but alſo as it reflects, as it returns to us, and brings us back for our fleſh his Spirit: That's a Myſterie, even Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, wherein of two is made <hi>una Caro,</hi> one
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107154:87"/>fleſh; but this is more, when we are joined to Chriſt <hi>per eundem,</hi> by one and the ſame Spirit. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are bold and induſtrious in the mintage of new words to expreſs the nearneſs of God and man in Chriſts Incarnation, by Corporation, Illumination, Adunation, Contemperation. But what man or Angel knows a word large and entire enough, and high enough to title that Union by wherein the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Man joined to the Lord is one Spirit, and changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory?</hi> This is that nuptial mentioned in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. and rementioned in the Goſpels; and all <hi>Solomons</hi> ſong, and <hi>Davids Pſalm</hi> 45. are Epithalamions, wholly ſpent in Celebration of this Solemnity. It was an happy Contract, the Union of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> when in the worlds Temple two Kingdoms were the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded pair; a gracious King was Prieſt, and the Sea like a marriage-ring encircling both. That was the way (had it held) for the education of both Realms to a Grandeur and Convaleſcence. And even in ſtory of time paſt it is a pleaſant, a delightſom Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to behold an Infant-ſtate riſe to maturity, as in <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Venice.</hi> But will you put out the eyes of all Hiſtory, or Poetry and diſ-illuſtre all the Senate, and becloud all the <hi>Clariſſimo's</hi> of all mankind? Look then upon God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt noble Incorporation, whereof all bodies Politick are but weak repreſentations. <hi>Excellent things are ſpoken of thee, thou City of God.</hi> And we know how large that holy Father <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is in delivery of thoſe excellent things in his <hi>Civitate Dei,</hi> whereof Chriſt is the ſupream Head. The parts of this ſociety, Kings and Prieſts venerable,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107154:88"/>and ſacred perſons in all antiquity; and where other bodies want a ſoul, the Ligament and ſoul of this body is the holy Ghoſt. <hi>For by one Spirit are we baptized into one body, and all made to drink into one Spirit, Eph.</hi> 4.4. So that in this Center all meet, Gods poſſeſſion, the Saints priviledge; and in that, theſe are become words all of one ſignification, His Choſen, His Holy, His own, His Royall, His Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People.</p>
            <p>Nor can this chuſe but prove a pure refined gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Conſolation indeed, when we find the proof in Gods own Teſtament, that Jeſus is not only the Mine wherein all the Treaſures of Wiſdom are hid, but Jeſus is the pure and grand golden Ingot of all the Comforts contained in holy Scriptures: out of which Ingot are coined ſo many Medals, ſome with Serpents and Anchors, and ſome with Lions, and Lilies, and Doves, and Crowns, and Roſes, and <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> too, good for <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor cordis,</hi> and all with the Effigies of that Croſs whereon our joyes depend, and wherein is found that <gap reason="foreign">

Shall we hope to reach it in a big compariſon, and ſo comprehend that which is incomprehenſible, and cannot enter into the heart of man to conceive? What Speaker can ſearch out words, fit for the unſearchable riches of Chriſt? As <hi>Sopor Domini</hi> is the language of the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107154:88"/>for the deepeſt ſleep, and <hi>Tuba Domini</hi> a ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for the loudeſt found, and <hi>Gandium Domini</hi> to expreſs the very joy of Heaven: ſo the Apoſtles, <hi>Gaudete in Domino,</hi> even here in the Kingdom of Grace, implies the beſt and pureſt conſolation.

This is comfort enough for every Chriſtian, to diminiſh, and bedwarf, and diſ-illuſtre all thoſe glimmerings and Glow-worms, all thoſe gleanings in riſled fields: and all that we are fain to feign to find in forelorn <hi>Ariadnes,</hi> that is, other mens leavings of Wealth, and Beauty, and Wit, and Honor, which are but empty Rinds, and Husks, and widowed ſhels, and ſhoos thrown away in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and wearineſs. And yet this Crown of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation here ſet on our ſouls in Grace, is topt, and phan'd, and crown'd again. This Conſummation hath another Conſummation yet above it. The Emperor that keeps his hungry Eagle ſtill, (poor man) when the Romiſh Harpyes have devoured his dainties, is glad after two duller Crowns to take a third of Gold which his holineſs (forſooth) puts on and off at pleaſure. But the Chriſtian faith which makes us Kings in Jeſus blood, and embalms us with his oyl of gladneſs, aſſures us of a tripled Comfort, when on thoſe Crowns of hope and joy

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107154:89"/>him for the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in this very notion and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Lord of Hoſts: For in him were all their <hi>Moſes</hi>'s &amp; <hi>Joſhuales,</hi> all their Captains and Saviours, their <hi>Baraks</hi> and <hi>Gideons,</hi> and <hi>Sampſons</hi> and <hi>Davids,</hi> and <hi>Macchabees,</hi> all reviv'd and reſtor'd to the world. But they knew not the manner of their King (and to miſtake a King, may be a world of miſery) nor of his Kingdom, nor the force of his Artillery in the dreadful Canon and Ordinance of his Word &amp; Spirit; Nor that the Scepter of his new Law ſhould prove the <hi>Iron Rod to break</hi> and ſubdue both men and Devils. They conſidered not his ſtupendious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, proving him the Lord of Hoſts, in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the whole frame of Heaven and Earth, and Seas, and all the hoſt of them, and bowing whole created nature to his obedience; To <hi>rebuke tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous winds</hi> &amp; <hi>roaring waves,</hi> as a Nurſe her child with Peace and be ſtill: nay, ſuſpend and ſilence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Devils of their poſſeſſions with a word. To lay his command on Death it ſelf, and force him to let go his hold after four dayes ſeiſure in the grave. Will <hi>Iews</hi> or Jewiſh hearts attend my voice, that would not hear the thunder of thoſe Miracles! But for ſupport of the true Catholick faith, and for the conſummation of all our conſolation, King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Chriſt Jeſus is become our <hi>Dominus Exercitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; Chriſto auſpice regno, &amp; regnabo</hi> too: and his bloody Croſs a braver badge then that of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi> This is <hi>polleus lux ipſa.</hi> For is it not he alone deſtroyes our raging luſts and nails them to his croſs? and he alone that 'gainſt a world of oppoſition, and all the oppoſition of this evil world, cryes to his hoſt, be of good comfort, <hi>I have overcome the world,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:107154:90"/>He alone that came to diſſolve &amp; deſtroy the works <hi>the ſtrong holds of Satan,</hi> and to vanquiſh <hi>powers and Principalities in high places,</hi> that had the vantage ground over us; He that breaks in on death and ſin and hell; and like a Conquerer in the triumphal Chariot of his Croſs <hi>made a ſhew of them openly,</hi> and as Triumphers uſ'd to do, when <hi>he aſcended up on high and led captivity captive, he gave gifts unto men.</hi> But yet more to prove him the Lord of Hoſts, by being more then that name can imply: for this Name is obſerved to be too yong for the <hi>ancient of Dayes:</hi> that is, a Name taken up ſince and from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Name indeed that draws and ſcatters on us all we can look for from our Maker and Preſerver. But all his powers and mercies are reſolved and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this Name of Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Without Chriſt, without God</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) in the world, we are but meer pieces of the maſſe, nay far worſe is our condition: <hi>born children of wrath,</hi> and in ſtate of <hi>enimies;</hi> and ſo the Lord of Hoſts is againſt us, and all the hoſts of Heaven and ſpirits of Hell, and all the creatures, and our ſelves againſt our ſelves. And when there was no <hi>Name under heaven to ſave and deliver us from preſent and wrath to come,</hi> then came this Prince of peace, and became our <hi>Peace;</hi> pledg'd himſelf for us, <hi>gave his life a Ranſome, ſo making peace:</hi> So prevailing over the Lord of Hoſts, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Almighty hands, and God content to accept terms of peace; may we not ſay ſo! Came not that Voyce from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in quo acquieſco, in whom I am at peace</hi> with all the world. If all this prove him not a Lord of Hoſts, he will one day to the further conſolation of all that love
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107154:90"/>his <hi>appearing,</hi> appear to the conſternation of all his Deſpiſers, <hi>in flaming fire to render vengeance.</hi> And as in the dayes of his fleſh then unglorified, and compaſt about with all mans infirmities, he could have been encompaſt with more then <hi>twelve Legions of Angels;</hi> ſo then he will meet thoſe two Hoſts, thoſe droves and flocks of <hi>ſheep and goats</hi> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Army of his Saints and Angels from Heaven, with whom we <hi>ſhall be caught up to meet that Lord in the ayr,</hi> and ſo ſhall be ever with the Lord.</p>
            <p>If we deſire yet higher to raiſe this Crown of conſummate conſolation in Chriſt, I will come to Viſions and Revelations. I will open that of St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Acts</hi> 7.56. <hi>I ſee heaven opened, and the ſon of man ſet on the right hand of God,</hi> which place being further opened by St. <hi>John,</hi> makes us ſee him on a Throne of Glory, covered with <hi>light as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under his feet Deaths pale head and a red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and all his enemies:</hi> about him ſtand the Armies of his Angels, and of mankind a greater number then any man can number, of all Nations &amp; Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; <hi>On his thigh that Name written, Rex Regum: &amp; Dominus Dominorum; The Elders caſting down their Crowns adore him that has many Crowns upon his head.</hi> And we may ſafely add this Title to thoſe Crowns of <hi>Dominus Exercituum,</hi> and rejoyce to think how thoſe Crowns are encinctur'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſ'd with precious ſtones for the twelve <hi>Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> and with manifold unions of God and man, of grace and glory, for the conſolation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo thereby fully made perfect, and <hi>partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> and all theſe Unions contracted in the blood red ſhining Summit of his croſs, by the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107154:91"/>power whereof that Throne and Robe, and all thoſe Crowns are become ours: and <hi>we become one with him</hi> in an union moſt high and holy, even <hi>as he and his Father are one;</hi> and higher we need not, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go, nor well ſo high; for that it ſhould be thus we ſcarce dare ask; but how it ſhould be thus, <hi>is above all that we are able to ask or think.</hi> Thus far the firſt priviledge of Gods ſervants in being his <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar;</hi> The ſecond now ſhould follow of being <hi>his Jewels,</hi> with the uſefull application of them both, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Aſſignation of thoſe ſeveral Dayes wherein theſe <hi>Jewels</hi> are to be made up: all which I believe will make up a ſecond and a third Exerciſe. For this time I proceed no further, but to beg the Bleſſing of God upon what we now have heard.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Word of God (ſaith St <hi>Paul,</hi>) is not bound, nor we that preach it, bound to Formalities and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Decencies, or much to care, whether our Hearers be in good humor or no; tis true; nor are we to be <hi>Time-ſervers,</hi> (as we have been charged) nor <hi>Men-pleaſers</hi> in any ill ſenſe: yet ſince we are at liberty throughout the Garden of the Scripture, to cull a Poſie, ſuch as ſeemes beſt to us, affording us a pleaſure, why
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107154:92"/>may we not be thought therein alſo to preſerve our juſt Devotion to God, together with an intention for the complacency of good men too? For which cauſe I bluſh not to acknowledge my reſpective choice, or rather my recollection of this Text, (whereon I have preacht in royal audience before) becauſe though it look back upon vicious times, and moſt ungodly men, yet it will allow us for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a Proſpect (as I verily belive) upon ſome choice ſpirits, and Gods gracious ſervants (yet by his Reſerve and ſpecial Mercy left alive) while they are yet alive, and I alive to apply this Scripture to them in ſpecial, which in general ſuits with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this time.</p>
            <p>As men the ſons of Time, ſo Times themſelves have their Parallels.

And we have no livelier proof that theſe are the laſt times, then ſuch our uſages, and in them ſuch our ſecurity. The Scripture foretels a ſoul and dangerous Sea of corruption that ſhould prove rough, and ſwell, run high, and the waves thereof rage horribly toward the end of the world; when men ſhould be more then imbrutiſhed, <hi>void</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, implacable, traiterous, heady, high minded, <hi>lovers of pleaſures more then lovers of God,</hi> pretending the Spirit, but being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, and bringing in damnable Hereſies, having a ſhow of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107154:92"/>pretending to Piety, and Law, and Order, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling Dignities which God hath ordained; with <hi>Balaam</hi> greedily loving the wages of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and periſhing in the contradiction of <hi>Core.</hi> But alas! We have undone both Propheſie and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, put down both Hiſtory and Poetry, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Imagination too; even thoſe Gyants before the flood are now not monſtrous, for we have defiled and made the earth more corrupt, filled it with a bloodier cruelty and violence, provoking the holy one of heaven to hurle down hils of miſeries on our heads and hearts, and to let in Torrents of his fierce wrath mingled wiih Chriſtian blood in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtreet, and a ſurrounding univerſal Scourge and Deluge to overwhelm three whole flouriſhing Kingdoms at once, from end to end, and burie them in endleſs deſolation; while ſenſeleſs ſinners we ſeem to contemn the Power of Gods wrath, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting looſe the reins to all licenciouſneſs, when he is pouring down the vials of his anger, and (tumbling delightfully in our own) tear up the wounds of our Saviour, betrampling the ſacred Blood that redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and counting the blood of his Covenant (a Covenant of Mercy and Peace) an unholy thing, crucifying again to our ſelves the Lord of Life and Glory, and making a mock of him, by grieving, quenching and doing deſpight to the Spirit of his Grace: So that our condition is worſe then of this people here, in this Prophet, though in very many things reſembling us; for in the firſt chapter we read of their Unkindneſs, Irreligiouſneſs, Profaneſs, ſnuffing at the Table of the Lord, and holding it contemptible. In the ſecond we find their Idolatry,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107154:93"/>Adultery, Infidelity. In this third Sorcery, falſe Swearing, Oppreſsion, Sacriledge; and at laſt it breaks into open rebellion and defiance of God, voting down all divine ſervice, and decreeing it vain, and no profit to walk longer in his Ordinances; and then this was a brave time (it muſt needs be ſo) for proud and wicked people which were lift up like a skum over the face of clear and wholſom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; only ſuch (ſaith our Prophet) were built to Wealth and Honor. And yet for all this ſorrow, there is a comfort comes up cloſe at the ſixteenth verſe, of uſe and advantage now for us. Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtill remained, though ſecret, not altogether ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; they ſpake one to another, admoniſhed, exhorted, comforted one another mutually; and theſe their Colloquies and Conſultations were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſuccesfull. God came into their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſate Preſident in this Council; and a book of Remembrance was written before him for all them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Which words afford a double priviledge of Gods ſervants (be the times what they will) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Owner deſcribed by his high and ſtately ſtile of <hi>Dominus Exercituum;</hi> Firſt, His own they are, his peculiar. Secondly, Eſteemed of him at a high rate; <hi>for they are his Jewels.</hi> There is a third part, The day or time ſet for the making up of theſe Jewels, admitting a four-fold Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107154:93"/>1. Either the day of puniſhing the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or 2. The day of powerfull preaching the Word. 3. The day of death; and 4. The laſt day, the day of final Judgement. In all theſe days God will manifeſt his Mercy and his Power, (both enwrapt in <hi>Dominus exercituum</hi> here) and then the Specification, the Verification, the real and actual ſpreading of both in this that God in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath ſpoken it; It ſhall certainly be ſo; for ſo ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. The firſt priviledge is laid down in this plain concluſion, They that in a Deluge of corruption are yet emergent, and bear up againſt the ſtream: they that in deſperate and diſſolute times dare yet prove that they fear this Lord of Hoſts, and think upon his name, they are Gods own, his peculiar. For ſo firſt the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> interpret this word, <hi>Segullah,</hi> by <hi>peculium, peculiare, proprium, ſpeciale, praecipuum, ſingulare,</hi> God hath a propriety, a ſpecialty in them. But I meddle no further with that firſt priviledge; it hath been the ſubject of a Sermon already: paſs we then to the ſecond priviledge;</p>
            <p>Which is, That Gods fearfull and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are his choice and reſerved Rarities. He is the great Preſerver of men, but for his own he hath a ſpecial Reſerve or Cabinet to lay them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: at leſt their ſtate and condition is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the nature and worth of Jewels. For this ſame word is by the ſame <hi>Rabbins</hi> alſo rendred in thoſe term of <hi>Argentum, Aurum, Lapides preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſi in Theſauro, Theſaurus dilectus, &amp; res deſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Geneva</hi> tranſlating a flock, are far ſhort of this words <hi>Energie,</hi> which we find.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107154:94"/>but in two places of Scripture beſide, and both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to our preſent purpoſe. God uſes it, and chooſes it in <hi>Exedus</hi> 19.5. for the decoring of his own people, the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who there he promiſes on their obedience ſhall be his chief trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And then <hi>David</hi> (with more advantage to us ſtill) uſes is in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3. to expreſs ſome reſerved choice Jewels which he dedicated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to the decoring of the Temple, the houſe he intended and prepared to build for the Lord. Now thoſe pretious ſtones we call by the name of Jewels, are a kind of natural glaſs, made out of a ſubtile mixture of earth and water, ſaith <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus.</hi> Others conceive them to be but purer Metals, as <hi>Plato</hi> imagined the Adamant a further excoction out of Gold. Another deſcribes them to be a kind of Light daintily confined to a terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thickneſs; but however ſramed by his divine hand, who worketh all in all things; mention we find of their uſe and eſteem even near the beginning, in <hi>Job</hi> 28. mention of the Onyx, Saphir, Topaz; deſcribing paradiſe, and naming <hi>Havilath, Moſes</hi> adds there is <hi>Bdellium,</hi> and the Onyx ſtone. The <hi>Iſraelitts</hi> borow Jewels of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.30. <hi>David</hi> takes the King of <hi>Rabbaths</hi> Crown of a Talent weight, ſet with preciovs ſtones: And mention again we find of precious ſtones brought by the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> and by <hi>Solomons</hi> Navy, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10. And that of the Prophet ſhews an ordinary uſe of them. Can a Maid forget her Ornaments, or a Bride her Jewels? But above all other, two places of Scripture, the 28. of <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and the 21 of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> In the firſt is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107154:94"/>
               <hi>Aarons</hi> Breſt-plate, with twelve precious ſtones figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the twelve Tribes: And in the other, the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of God with her foundation on twelve precious ſtones, ſhaddowing out the twelve Apoſtles, both conferring much ſtrength to this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To deſcend then to ſome (but few) particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in this Reſemblance, look firſt how the ſtone or Jewel depends not on the Merchants Report or mad credulity of the vulgar: their Honor, and Eſteem, and Approbation is from a skilfull Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, an exact Work-man, a cunning and profeſt Jeweller indeed: So the Apoſtle ſleights the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of common breath: I paſs not to be judged by you; not he that commends himſelf to others, or whom others, but whom God commends. So 'tis here a comfort drawn from the <hi>Mine, You ſhall be Mine (ſaith the Lord of hoſts.)</hi> 'Tis I lay claim that will juſtifie you; <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge,</hi> not of mans <hi>but of Gods Elect?</hi> Let the baſe world put you to the touch and trial; I will avouch and warrant you ſound and good amidſt an heap of droſs and counterfeits: And hence that difference noted by our Saviour, That which is vile among men, is highty eſteemed of God: and contrary, Men deviſe to put him by whom God will exalt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62.4. And no wonder if a gracious ſervant of God ſee himſelf ſo uſed: God himſelf was abuſed ſo. The ſtone which the Builders refuſed, threw by among the rubbiſh, that God made (ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi>) elect and precious, and ſet him right in his own place again, the Chief, the Headſtone of the Corner, where both wals meet to ſupport both
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107154:95"/>Church and State. The world may guild, enamel and perfume great ones, and proceed in prodigious flattery, till it come to Suffumigations and Altars, as we read of ſome both Heathen and Chriſtian; and yet theſe Deifications, &amp; theſe Canonizations done to ſuch as are in Gods ſight abominable. Again it may and often doth account ſuch as droſs as have his Image and Superſcription, ſuch as are encircled with this Motto here, of <hi>Faciam eos in Gemmas, — In that day when I make up my jewels.</hi> The world will ſay to a righteous man, if nor rich, nor potent, ſit here at my footſtool: but God that ſees the heart, and beholds the radiance of his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment, and how clear it ſits upon his ſoul, will ſay as in the Goſpel, <hi>Friend, ſit up higher.</hi> The world caſts duſt and obſcurity upon them that are good; But God makes that true of them which is ſpoken of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> in the funerals of <hi>Junia, — Eo ipſo praefulgebant quod non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebantur.</hi> The world cries up the Noble, the Rich, the Wiſe; God cries them down as faſt, Not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe, not many noble, not many mighty are called. The world proceeds in miſchief, and envy, and madneſs againſt honeſt men, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> deals with ingenuous Writers. Dare he ſpeak full Truth, and ſo diſgrace her Impoſtures? Away with him, a Spung and a <hi>Deleatur</hi> ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſh him, and extinguiſh him. But God the true Corrector of the preſs, <hi>Judex</hi> and <hi>Vindex,</hi> upon a Review, comes, and commands with his powerfull <hi>Inſeratur,</hi> and re-inveſts with former honor, re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and re-inthrones his ſervants, and gives them juſt cauſe to rejoyce and ſay, <hi>This is the Lords
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107154:95"/>doing, and it is marvailous in our eyes: Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Jewels</hi> by reaſon of Gods working them out of the rough and firſt <hi>Quarrie.</hi> So dealt he with his deareſt <hi>Jewel</hi> that lay from all Eternity in the boſom of his Father, <hi>the brightneſs of his Glory, and the engraven form of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. 1. in whom though there was no ſin to work out, yet was in his humane nature, cut from the ſame <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi> clouded <hi>with afflictiont,</hi> and <hi>compaſſed about with all mans infirmities;</hi> in his birth <hi>Daniels ſtone cut forth without hands,</hi> Dan. 2.34. and in his death <hi>Zacharies ſtone graven, and cut full of eyes all over, Zach.</hi> 3.9. Not to mention thoſe main <hi>Furnaces of affliction,</hi> whereby he was conſecrate and poliſht for us. And yet as in the midſt of all, to give a taſte of his Divinity, God <hi>transfigur'd him on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> made him ſhine as the Sun in his ſtrength: ſo when his time was fully come, the day that this Jewel muſt be made up, Firſt, his Body is glorified on earth, and then aſſum'd into Heaven, and a place for this precious Gem at his own right Hand, above Principalities and Powers, <hi>and a Name given him above all names.</hi> And now that bleſſed Face wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw no beauty, yet <hi>was fairer then the ſons of men,</hi> which they defiled and ſpit upon, is ador'd by <hi>Seraphims, and both Heaven and earth are full of the Majeſty of his Glory.</hi> Now God obſerves the ſelf-ſame method in all the reſt; finds them out among the refuſe of the world, amongſt flocks and herds of Nations; from the firſt rude <hi>quarrie</hi> of the Chaos, from utter vacuity and nothing, aſſembles
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107154:96"/>their attoms and ſmalleſt duſt: breaths in a lively ſpirit, exalts, purifies it, grafts on it Knowledge, Faith, Love, Holineſs; and having begun a good work of Grace, never leaves it till he bring it to perfection, filing away their droſs, and grinding out their grains and Ices, and clouds of corruption, till he hath refin'd them to a brightneſs; as in St. <hi>Paul</hi> a rough ſtony-hearted perſecutor, wrought by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſcales and barks pull'd away, <hi>to become a choſen veſſel to bear his name among the Gentiles,</hi> Act 9. A bright ſtar on earth, and now a glorious Saint in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Jewels</hi> then thirdly they are for that care and love which God affords them: men prize their Jewels, Reſerve them curiouſly, take a glory and perplacency in poſſeſſing and wearing them. So God having bought them at a price ineſtimable, <hi>purchaſed not with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as of a Lamb undefiled and without ſpot;</hi> then he ſets his heart upon them: all <hi>his delight is in the Saints that excel.</hi> Thoſe he tenders <hi>as the Apple of his eye,</hi> ſets them as <hi>Joſiah</hi> for a <hi>ſeal</hi> and a <hi>Signet on his right hand; hides them under the ſhadow of his wings;</hi> and ſo alſo God glories in them, and holds them out to the amazement and confuſion of the world of groſs and earthly ſouls, which are as foils to their perfections, and commands them to do him grace, and to be an Ornament to him. <hi>Let your light ſhine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again. The Compariſon would hold (for the task is eaſie to purſue an Allegory) for Rarity; <hi>Rari quippe boni — apparent rari in gurgite Vaſto,</hi> in a ſea of froth and foam: and for the place, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107154:96"/>manner of breeding and growth. But I forſake the reſt, and chuſe to inſiſt only on Properties, reſpecting which Righteous men are juſtly term'd Jewels, and chiefly two; of clearneſs and luſtre firſt, and then of firmneſs and ſolidity, which are the <hi>

            <p>Other Properties they aſcribe to precious ſtones, and ſome ſuch as are marvailous. The Jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (ſayes <hi>Pliny</hi>) was wont to be worn in all the Oriental Regions as an Amulet againſt poyſon, and is of vertue to expel noyſome dreams and Viſions, to clear the eyes, and aſſiſts againſt all adverſity. So the Saphir in a Ring or Amulet contributes toward all proſperity, encreaſes Devotion, and helps againſt

Others are reported vertuous, (and thoſe I am uſe you could wiſh me) to help a man to elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and to make him quick of diſpatch. But now I confeſs I allow not this for a point of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor put it to you as a piece of good Hiſtory, for in the ſtories and traditions of theſe things, I doubt not but there is a maſs and mixture of praeſtigious vanity and untruth; yet am not I of their mind ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, that think all Jewels v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Allowing then a poſſibility for many of theſe Properties in precious ſtones, we may reduce all to two Specialties. 1. They do encourage to good. 2. And preſervefrom evil, both of ſin and puniſhment; and herein however qualified in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they may ſurely be of good uſe for us to make an apt reſemblance, and to expreſs the condition of righteous ſouls: ſuch ſervants of God as fear him and think upon his name. Theſe are Jewels to the world in example, ſtirring and provoking others to emulation: ſhining in the <hi>midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation:</hi> And theſe are they that like <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom</hi> reſtrain the vengeance, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming <hi>ſtorms of fire from Heaven</hi> upon a world of ungodly wretches.

But the cunning Stateſman laughs at this, and ſhakes his head to think that honeſty or Religion ſhould preſcribe to ſuch Grandees, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents of fine but unrighteous Policy; That the Bible, or the Rules, or the grace indeed deriv'd from thence, ſhould afford a way of enabling men in diſcharge of that Duty which is ſeen in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Lucian</hi> he likes, but <hi>Machiavel</hi> admires; thoſe are his Scriptures. Yet let ſuch a man take
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107154:99"/>the experimental proof of this from ſecular ſtory. <hi>Seneca</hi> the Jewel of <hi>Neroes</hi> youth, and a braver Defence and Ornament then that ſo famous Jaſper of his, wherein he was pourtrai'd, arm'd compleatly; but his Armour of proof was <hi>Seneca,</hi> preſerving him five whole years in a form of Regiment equal to the beſt of his Predeceſſors. But his Jewel once thrown away, he fell to all exceſs of wickedneſs. Or if a Scripture-ſtory may paſs, let him look on that 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. it may ſerve abundantly for all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. <hi>Joas</hi> a yong King, yet <hi>does right in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> ſo long as his Jewel lived; the Text is plain, all the dayes of <hi>Jehojada</hi> the Prieſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Collections for repair of Gods Houſe, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Sacrifices renewed; But when this Jewel was call'd for back to Heaven to be treaſur'd there at <hi>ver.</hi> 17. come the Princes of <hi>Judah</hi> (no worſe) and they crouch &amp; make obeyſance to the King; for what? for a change of Religion, and how ſucceeds it? as they could wiſh. <hi>For the King hearkened to them, and ſo they left the houſe of the Lord God of their fathers, and ſerved groves and Idols.</hi> And as in States and Common-wealths, ſo in Cities, and Towns, and private Families Gods ſervants in the due preſervation and practice of Piety and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are as means of encouragement to others; ſo cauſes alſo of Reſtraint from evil of ſin, many ſins of ſwearing, whoring, drunkenneſs, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preventers of Gods judgements for ſuch ſins. As <hi>Moſes</hi> interpoſ'd himſelf as a precious Jewel of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue in his prayer: and <hi>Aaron</hi> with his fire betwixt the living and the dead, and cauſed the Deſtruction to ſtop there. So no queſtion while
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107154:99"/>juſt men live, the whole Countrey, Town, Family is the better bleſt; and when they dye, God takes them <hi>away from the evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far the bodily part of the Sermon in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this ſecond priviledge of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>They are his Jewels.</hi> Now to infuſe a ſoul by breaking this ſpeculation into practice, into ſuch uſes as I account the very life of preaching; For our firſt uſeful extraction then is to teach us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts true Honour, Joy, Nobility, Bleſſedneſs. 'Tis not in the endowments of Nature, not in thy large capacity, or faithful memory, ſwift apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thy penetration of judgement or facility of Elocution, not in thy height or depth of learning; no, nor in the exerciſe of moral vertue, thy valour or thy bounty, though theſe are Ornaments I wiſh on all my friends: much leſs is it in thy purſe, or clothes, or titles. Not though thou wert a <hi>Joſeph</hi> or a <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay;</hi> to feed in Gold, be dreſt in Purple, ſit next the King, and be call'd his couſin, which are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Eſdras</hi> for the prime favours of an earthly Monarch; for alas, all theſe things mayſt thou have, and yet be but a meer worldling, and after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve to a worſe maſter. Kings may give their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and Popes bequeath their darlings and their Nephues earth and ayr, Title &amp; Territory, and make them Lords of ſo many Parks, Mannors, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Towns, Counties: Yet if but one victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Army of boyes or Peſants chance to over-run a Kingdom with noiſe of <hi>weapons,</hi> as the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, and <hi>rowling of garments in blood,</hi> what then become; of all their glory, their Pattents and painted wax? If then you ſeek for right enobling,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107154:100"/>and to be truly honorable, or if you would be men of good eſtates indeed, and enjoy certainties and perpetuities, ſludy to be in the favour and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lord of Hoſts; for then however it go for this world, you ſhall be ſure of Eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs in another, <hi>at that day when he ſhall make up his Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a contrary uſe for all thoſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſouls as pride themſelves in being none of Gods Elect, that mock at mention of Grace and Godlineſs, whoſe language is fully recorded in the ſecond of <hi>Wiſdim,</hi> and their Poſterity to this day praiſe their ſaying, and continue the ſame frontleſs impudence. A Race of impious ſcorners, <hi>Solomons</hi> fools, imagining it the utmoſt of diſgrace that can be ſtuck upon them, to be call'd or counted Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or Lovers of God, a profeſſion fit for a crue of ſullen melancholy ſimpletons. Mean time in what a fearful condition do theſe Jewels of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil live I and glory <hi>in their ſhame</hi> and perdition! for let me ſpeak to ſome one roaring Leader of this band, and ſay, who hath bewitcht thee into this Deluſion? It may indeed advance thee to ſome friend ſhips and full tables, that thou art a full ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a curious drunkard, or an Eloquent Hiſtorian of thoſe ſins wherewith thy body bewrayes thy youth to have abounded and yet thou art content to belye thy ſelf in the Relation; and being thus far from remorſe, thus given over to a Reprobate mind, thou art not able to conceive the Apoſtle, where he tells thee, <hi>they are without hope that are without God, and that it is a fearful thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands;</hi> what is it to fall out of the hands of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107154:100"/>the living God? and ſo that he which made thy ſoul, filled it with noble faculties, offers it Grace, and Holineſs, and Purification, ſhould be forced by thy wilful rejection of Grace and Mercy to give over his work, to caſt thee off for ever, that thy ſoul ſhould contract ſo much droſs and defilement; thy works of darkneſs ſo extinguiſh all impreſſions of Light and Beauty, as thy Creator ſhould not, I am ſure will not own thee, but ſay to thy everlaſting horror and aſtoniſhment, <hi>Depart from me, I know no ſuch workers and boaſters of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly to trie our ſelves; Doſt thou believe that God eſteems thee as a Jewel, purchaſed by Jeſus blood, and that he ſets his heart upon thee? O take heed this be not vanity and mad preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Reflect on what we ſaid laſt of thoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inherent or aſcribed to precions ſtones, and ſhew me firſt thy faith by thy works: What are the vertues and precious operations of thy faith and profeſſion? If thou beeſt of a refined and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nature, thou wilt be a grace and an honor to thy God; And where is that thy love to his name, thy zeal to his glory? and then is thy life operative upon others, by thy example won to goodneſs; Art thou preciſely carefull and curious to preſerve others, ſpecially thoſe within thy charge from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Idleneſs, Prophaneſs, Wantonneſs, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, Drunkenneſs? Or on the contrary, Is thy manner of converſing with men ſcandalous and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, ſinfull and ſhamefull? O remember then, however thou mayeſt have a name to live, thou art but dead, though thou ſeem pure in thy own eyes, or the applauſe of Paraſites; yet thoſe eyes truly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107154:101"/>enlightned, would ſee thy own deformity, that thou art yet in thy ſins, and not cleanſed from thy wickedneſs; yet in thy pure, that is, thy impure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals, and far from being any Partaker of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. Conſider then our ſelves by thoſe two propertie, eſpecially, Solidity and Clearneſs. Firſt, Are we firm and ſound, no counterfeits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the practice as well as profeſſion of Chriſt? Never worſe times then theſe of late, but never better times for trial: And if our hearts have been preſerved unſhaken, there is yet a Scrutiny and an Inqueſt after our Holineſs, and Purity, and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for God will have his Jewels untainted. Our God is of pure and fiery eyes, and no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure thing muſt tarry in his ſight: Come out ſaith God, and touch no unclean thing. and then you ſhall be precious in my ſight, be my <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. In thoſe precious ſtones on <hi>Aarons</hi> breſt-plate was engraven Holineſs to the Lord; and Gods material Temple ſo beautified, tipically preſcribes what thoſe ſouls ſhould labor to be which God vouchſafes to make Temples for his holy Spirit. Unclean ſpirits inhabit wicked ſouls, but the holy Ghoſt takes it in deſpite, is grieved and quencht with our pollutions: and ſo for God the Father, <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> he will not endure the deeds of darkneſs under colour of his ſervice. Pure religion and undefiled even before God the Father, is in a main branch to keep a mans ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted of the world, <hi>James</hi> 1. <hi>ulc. i. e.</hi> eſcaping the corruptions which are in the world through luſts. <hi>God is good to Iſrael, i. e.</hi> to all that are of a clean heart. Indeed a Jewel of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:107154:101"/>hath its honor thence; <hi>vocatus fuit inclytus</hi> is the Paraphraſe, ſo called for its excelling Purity. And ſo laſtly in reference to our bleſſed Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt, that redeemed us to be a peculiar people to himſelf, and like himſelf. <hi>Tiberius</hi> would not ſuffer the image of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in Ring or Coin to be born into any unſeemly Place; ſo the adopted Sons and Servants of God will be carefull of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing the glorious Image of Chriſt Jeſus, ſealed and imprinted in their ſouls, by admitting ſtains and blemiſhes; but be carefull to abſtain from the leaſt appearance of evil, <hi>and to purifie themſelves, even as he is pure;</hi> becauſe till then he is not throughly enamour'd of his ſpouſe the Church, till her neck be comely with rowes of ſtones, till ſhe be as the Roſe and Lilly, all fair, and no ſpot in her.</p>
            <p>Yet all this is ſpoken, and muſt be taken with the Apoſtles Caution and Reſtriction, not as if any had, or ever could attain perfection here: No, they reckon a number of infirmities that the moſt precious Jewels are ſubject to. There is <hi>Fumus &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra, Nubeculae, Scabrities, Capillus, Sal, Punctum, Scobes, Plumbago, Ferrugo, Rubigo, Vomica,</hi> which diſtain the pureſt ſtones; So in the choiceſt of Gods people, in the rareſt veſſels of his honor prepared unto Glory, remain thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, like Clouds and Ices. They have all their grains, and ſpots, <hi>&amp; Delict a quotidianae incurſionis;</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of the Churches brightneſs and perfection, adds — <hi>Ad hoc Electa, non ut jam ſit talis, ſed ut ad hoc paretur.</hi> Their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be true, becauſe unfeigned, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fair, ſave only by compariſon. So hath ſin
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107154:102"/>poiſoned the fountain, and ſuch a phyſical and real Influence it hath on all mans habits and actions. And if the eſtate of the beſt and pureſt be no better, what ſhall we boaſt our ſelves, who as they ſay of <hi>Northern Jewels,</hi> that they are of a vicious ſoftneſs, and will not endure the file? ſo certainly in reſpect of the primitive Chriſtians, when the Church was a true heaven upon earth, we are as far from the brightneſs and miracles of their works, as from their firm and miraculous faith. It remains that we encourage our ſelves, and ſtir up the Grace of God that is in us; and though we cannot approve our ſelves in a perfection to a perfect God, in whoſe eyes the moon ſhines not, (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) and the ſtars are impure, yet if we be but vigilant to dreſs the paradiſe of our ſouls, and keep out the Tempter, preſerving our breaſt at a garden encloſed, and a fountain ſealed up; if we but earneſtly contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints, and labor to ſhake off the ſin that cleaves ſo faſt unto our nature, if we run and preſs to the mark and ſtrive to purifie our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and to grow up into full holineſs; ſuch is then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Grace, and Goodneſs, and tender mercy of our gracious God, that he not only aſſiſts, but accepts of our weak endeavors and approaches, ſo far as to impute the very Act of cleanſing and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining pardon too, to ſuch a frail condition and contention. We do not, we dare not ſay with <hi>Bellarmine de purg. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. it pleaſes Chriſt to joyn our ſatisfactions with his own; but by our complying under the hand of God, and intention and love to work according to the influx of divine
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107154:102"/>Grace, we do by his indulgence impetrate for thoſe ſins, for which we can never make compenſation. And as the Scripture enforms us of a cleanſing by Redemption, and Remiſſion through the blood of our bleſſed Saviour, and a ſecond by application of that blood, and a third by infuſed Regeneration; ſo there is a fourth of mortifying and repreſsing of Concupiſcence, ſubjecting to the Regiment of Grace, and alſo in renouncing and expelling ſin by the contrary Acts of vertue and obedience of faith, and works of Light expelling Darkneſs; wherefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All that have this hope in them, have purged themſelves even as he is pure;</hi> And again, <hi>You have purified your ſouls by obedience to the Truth, through the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. Here then for a cloſe, fals in fitly that exhortation of <hi>Zophar</hi> in <hi>Jab</hi> 11.14. <hi>If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedneſs dwell in thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles; for then ſhalt thou lift up thy face without ſpot, yea, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and not fear; thine age ſhall be clearer then the noon-day; thou ſhalt ſhine forth, and be as the morning:</hi> But all this is ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that condition in <hi>verſe</hi> 13. which is, <hi>If thou prepare thy heart, and ſtretch forth thy hands towards him;</hi> which puts us in mind of Invocation, and the uſe of Prayer for Gods aſſiſtance. For as it is with Pearls according to the dew which it receives from Heaven in quantity and quality, ſo doth the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh breed her Pearl; and after the Meaſure, and Showr, and Proportion, and Inſtilment of divine Grace, which our ſouls drink in, we increaſe and grow in Purity and Sanctification, and therefore we ſhould put this into our hourly Letany, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Text at firſt and ſecond open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afforded us a double privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods people in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their owner, ſtiled here by his high and ſtately Title of <hi>Dominus Exercituum;</hi> Firſt, <hi>They are his own, his peculiar;</hi> and then <hi>they are his Jewels.</hi> In handling the firſt Priviledge, I endeavoured to diſcover a Mine of Conſolation even in this; and drew certain Materials from this Mine; namely, the radiant mingle of Light and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107154:104"/>joy diſcernable in a Chriſtians Profeſſion, Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Converſation. Secondly, the Connexion and Combination of Graces and Mercies from God obſervable in this Text, pitcht like a Tabernacle with Curtains and Coverings, with Loops and taches of comfort coupled one to another in Conjunctions. And thirdly, the Expanſion and Dilatation thereof over all Adverſity: &amp; then the conſerve &amp; Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all our comfort in our great Protector, who is <hi>Dominus Exercituum,</hi> And laſtly, I ſet on the Crown and conſummation of all Conſolation in Chriſt Jeſus. In our Diſcourſe upon the ſecond priviledge of Gods ſervants, in being his Jewels, was ſhewn in what reſpects eſpecially this Metaphor is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in what qualities the reſemblance chiefly is moſt clear and uſeful to us. All which being done, that which is left us now to do, is a Retroſpect and a Proſpect: to look back firſt to the very Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work and Foundation whereon God layes this whole pile of Comfort, which will be found to be nothing but his holy fear; and then we are the more chearfully to look and go forward with the end of our Text and the end of our Faith, and Hope and Pravers; that in the work of God upon our bodies and ſouls in thoſe ſeveral dayes wherein he promiſes and will perform <hi>this making up of his Iewels;</hi> which dayes are four. Firſt, the Day of puniſhing the ungodly. Secondly, the Day of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful preaching the Word; then the Day of Death; and laſt, the Day of the laſt Judgement,</p>
            <p>Our firſt buſineſs (and it is indeed the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs) is to look to our Foundation. <hi>Other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can no man lay, but what is laid,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:107154:104"/>that is, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Thats moſt ſure, but ſo is this alſo, <hi>that every one which calls on the Name of the Lord muſt depart from iniquity:</hi> and this again as ſure as the reft, that without inſtruction and divine wiſdom no man is able to do that; and then the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to that wiſdom is This Foundation of Fear. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wiſdom.</hi> And there God begins here, and we muſt follow his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Look back into the former words, and you ſhall find the qualification of his ſervants. Thoſe that he allows for his, and will one day reſerve as <hi>his jewels,</hi> are <hi>they</hi> that in perilous and corrupt times do <hi>fear before him, and think upon his name: They,</hi> there is an Emphaſis to be placed on them. <hi>They,</hi> and none but <hi>they ſhall be mine.</hi> Three things we may touch in this obſervation: Firſt, God requires this qualification. Secondly, we are to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it in our ſelves. Thirdly, to comfort our ſelves in Gods Grace and Mercy in this Appropriation, that both this Amulet is tyed to a mans own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and alſo all conſolation in God grounded upon his Fear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God will have ſuch as are capable of this Deſcription here: no talk of comfort without this qualification; when St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes <hi>God is no accepter of perſons, Act.</hi> 10.34. that word is but a regarder of Faces, and refers only to that diſtinction which he had newly learnt of God, to be no longer an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barment, <hi>a wall of partition,</hi> that is the difference of Jew and Gentile. A Jew was now of no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, no better accepted then any other nation: but in the next verſe, he aſſures himſelf, and his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and us, and all: that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, He that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107154:105"/>fears God, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Thats the man, by way of Excellency. That man that fears him, ſhall not need to fear his being accepted of him, and ſo God is an accepter of perſons: a curious Decipherer, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act culler out of ſuch as ſhall be his ſervants, takes no mans word: <hi>Veneris commendat epiſtola Marti,</hi> — thats uſual among men; a great mans or a great womans letter; and we eſteem it of weight, that poor addition of a proper, of an handſom man: <hi>But God ſees not as man ſees,</hi> ſayes <hi>Samuel</hi> at the ſight of many proper men; <hi>looks not on the outward appearance;</hi> but what we ballance leaſt, is of moſt value with him. Honeſty, Religion, an heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a holy fear of God. And then though it is ſaid <hi>his thoughts are not as mans thoughts,</hi> yet he tells us here, that man only that finds God in his own heart, is <hi>a man after Gods own heart:</hi> and he that ſo thinks upon Gods name, God will ſo think upon him, that he will hear him, hearken to him, and ſet him down in the Book of his Remembrance, in the former <hi>verſe;</hi> and in this <hi>verſe</hi> of my Text, he <hi>will own him, make him up</hi> one day <hi>for his jewel,</hi> and <hi>ſpare him as a man ſpares his own ſon</hi> that ſerves him. So that all this cry and trail of Bleſſings before, and in, and after the text, depend upon, they belong to, and liſten after that which is paſt, of Fear and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. For it were not fit that any perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified ſhould have ſo large, ſo excellent a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this, which embraces, which contains all that the ſoul can receive here or hereafter; For God changes not their tenure, not his very term of <hi>mine,</hi> at that laſt, and dreadful, and joyful day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But then it ſhall be made evident in the eys
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107154:105"/>and a truth enforced upon the hearts of all ſuch ſouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers at Religion as are mentioned in <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. The wiſdom of all ſuch prophane contemners of Devotion, as ſay it is in vain to ſerve God, and <hi>what profit,</hi> &amp;c. at <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>ſhall be blaſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and then you ſhall diſcern,</hi> ſayes the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> then you ſhall find a difference betwixt the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the wicked, <hi>between him that ſerves God and him that ſerves him not.</hi> But in mean time thoſe glorious and theſe gracious <hi>Speranda &amp; fruenda</hi> are all incorporate in theſe <hi>Agenda</hi> here. God will have ſuch a field for his ſeed, ſuch trees to graft up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch Materials to raiſe his Temple. Otherwiſe as no earthly Prince how gracious ſoever will hear and hearken to, and put ſuch a ſervant down in <hi>his book of Remembrance</hi> as ſhall apparently forget his duty to him: ſo God hath teſtified abundantly that on <hi>Iſraels</hi> defection, he will neglect his own Property &amp; Propriety, his own choice of his choſen <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; <hi>they,</hi> even <hi>They</hi> ſhall be the generation of his <hi>wrath, Ier</hi> 7.29. liable to that fierce wrath of that God <hi>who is a conſuming fire,</hi> &amp; a generation of his wrath, fuel of his wrath, till their end here, and of his endleſs wrath hereafter. As it is one way upon Repentance he <hi>blots out all their ſins from his Remembrance,</hi> ſo from <hi>his Remembrance, he blots out all the Promiſes of this book</hi> upon their contempt; Forgets then what he had ſaid of his <hi>firſt-born,</hi> and <hi>rebu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing even kings for their ſakes,</hi> his dear Child for whom his bowels were troubled; the <hi>Signet on his hand, tender as the apple of his eye; heires by Promiſe; All,</hi> all evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; becauſe all <hi>ſubconditione,</hi> of applying their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107154:106"/>hearts to the Covenant: and that Covenant is here eſtabliſht and renewed with us in theſe terms <hi>of fearing the Lord, and thinking on his Name.</hi> This is our firſt particular in this Foundation of comfort to look to our qualification, becauſe God admits none but of this temper. The ſecond by way of application to every ſingle breſt, is to ſearch and examine our ſelves whether we have this bleſſed <hi>Fear,</hi> and holy thoughtfulneſs; and ſo can thence fairly argue and prove our own being <hi>Gods</hi> own; our peculiar priviledge of being <hi>Gods peculiar.</hi> For firſt this may be known; for the Spirit of God is not in his ſervants, ſpiritual men, as the foul ſpirit by poſſeſſion or obſeſſion in a Pythoniſſe, or ſuch as are his ſenſleſs utenſils, and perceive not the power that tranſports them, feel not the operation of their Mover: and thence it is that we have ſo frequent Monitories, (which were vain and uſeleſs if it could not be done) of <hi>prove your ſelves, try the ſpirits, know you not that Chriſt is in you except ye be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi> And indeed though a man will find, or fain to find a Dictamny, a medicine made of wine, and noiſe and company to throw off the Arrow; and ſome men think it <hi>probatum</hi> that there is (in this ſenſe) a ſword-cure, that is, there is an eaſie way to heal up any wound that the ſword of the Spirit, the word of God in the Miniſtry of his ſervant can make; it is but ſleighting the Preacher, or allowing him for a blunt or bold fellow; and the Sermon a dull or a dry piece; yet ſuch a man knows he does but diſſemble in all this, <hi>and withold the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> bemiſting and darkening his own
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107154:106"/>conſcience, or elſe that <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> that Prophet in his own boſom, (if ſhe might be heard) would make him wiſer: teach him better and clearer, then the moſt illuſtrious Divines, that is the beſt, that is the plaineſt Teachers. For that incorrupt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Judge is joyn'd in Commiſſion with the Holy Ghoſt <hi>to lead us into all Truth;</hi> and to bring all ſuch, that is, all needful truth to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. The <hi>Spirit of God bears witneſs, but it is with our ſpirit,</hi> and ſo enables us to pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſelf-clearing, or ſelf-condemnation. When therefore I dare knock at that privy Chamber door, at that cloſet, and dare ask that queſtion, Am I a Divine Royaliſt, a true Deilift, a godly Chriſtian? One of Gods peculiar? where then is my fear, my thinking on his Name? Do I ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce before him with reverence? Do I indeed as one of his Royal Prieſthood preſent my body and ſoul, and all their children, all their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, the actions of my hands, and the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my heart and projects of my brain <hi>as a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice</hi> unto my God? Does my juſtice and honeſty, my chaſtity and ſobriety (for even theſe may riſe from corrupt ſprings) flow from this only conſideration? Is the bottom of my conceited hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs any better then a ſick mans dream, or mad mans boiling fancy? Do I indeed feel my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence grounded on a modeſt, a tender and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential fear? Doe the Larum, the remembrance of this ſtrike louder and faſter in my breſt then all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations? with <hi>meminto Philippe, Henrics, Garole;</hi> not that thou art but a man, but that thou
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107154:107"/>art no mans man, nor no womans man, nor no devils man taken captive to do his Will: This I muſt thus enquire, and this when I thus know, then I muſt reſolve with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Let others do what they will; <hi>I and my houſe,</hi> at the leaſt, I and my heart, and all that is within me <hi>will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Shall ſuch a man as I that profeſs Chriſt and his Goſpel, <hi>ſhall I flie</hi> ſaith one? <hi>Can I do this wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Shall I take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of an harlot? ſaith another of Gods fearfull and faithfull ſervants; God forbid: Do I profeſs to ſerve that Lord of Hoſts, who keeps a book of Remembrance, whoſe eye is ever zenith, and ſo pure, that no iniquity can tarry in his ſight, and ſhall I not paſs the time of my dwelling here in fear of his moſt bleſſed name? And do we, can we think then, nay do they, or can they, (ſay what they will) can they indeed think in good earneſt, can they believe themſelves to be Gods peculiar people, and ſuch a Prieſt-hood and choſen People, as Chriſt ſhed his precious blood to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, who though they dare not but fear men, and tremble at the ſound of ſome great name on earth, yet have no true fear of God before their eyes; ſuch as dare curſe, ſwear, pollute and blaſpheme that very name, in which both we and they profeſs to look for both Protection and Salvation!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Our third and laſt particular in this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation about the Ground-work of all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts bottom'd on our fear of God, is the joy and bleſſing the Grace and Mercy, &amp; tender indulgence of God unto us in this Appropriation, that God
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107154:107"/>vouchſafes to tie this cordial joy faſt to each ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Chriſtian, &amp; ſo admits him under this ſignet to be of his cabinet Council in the inward Teſtimony of his Spirit, aſſuring him &amp; his ſpirit that he is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ords own, that ſo the Joy of his faithfull ſervants may (as himſelf hath ſpoken it) be full, and that not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in another, but by finding and feeling the Ground and Principles of true Joy and Confidence in themſelves. For I am not therefore honeſt or valiant, becauſe ſome credulous brethren, or ſome brethren of the Sword repute me ſo, and would ſo give it under their hands: No, I paſs not for yours, or any <hi>mans Judgement</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) a ſilly fame is that, into which a man is voted, or for which he hath a Teſtimonial or Certificat. I know ſaith he, <hi>in whom I have believed;</hi> and ſo every juſt and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified man lives by his own faith, as well as he lives by that very bread which himſelf eats. It is no truſting to Salvation implicite, if I pin my ſoul to that great name of the Catholique Church, and know no meaning of it, but only him that calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Head of it, when he can be ſcarce, or but at moſt a corrupt member; or if I make a Pope of that poor private Prieſt that creeps in at my win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. If I freely reſign my ſoul to him, and ſay I muſt confide in you, for ſo millions profeſs and boaſt themſelves to do; Can I tell whether this <hi>Romiſt</hi> will cary it to Heaven or Hell. or neither in haſte, but make it ſtay in purgatory (as ſome ſouls they tell me muſt do) till the day of Judgement? I cannot reliſh that dependance on any mans infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; for if I could be certain of their high
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107154:108"/>Prieſts election, that all things therein had been rightly and canonically performed, which is very difficult, if not impoſſible; yet for his low Prieſt, whom he ſends to me, and who for his own food and maintenance, brings me the Sacraments of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and the wafer-god to be aſſured of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (on which they teach the very eſſence of all Popiſh devotion depends) they muſt acquaint me how I ſhall be a Searcher of hearts, which God hath reſerved only to himſelf; and therefore aſſuredly as ſome Papiſts have openly jeared the pretended infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of their Father; ſo no doubt but his white ſons the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> like the Latine Augurs do laugh when they meet in ſecret, at the open gullage of the world, willing to miſtake their infamous mother for the very Catholique Church in the Apoſtles Creed; and yet our own Ladies in ſtead of Preſerves from St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> boxes of <hi>Praſcriptum Legis &amp; Pradicta Prophetarum,</hi> which are ſoundly mingled with this holy ſear in the Text, are content to ſwallow their conſerves of implicite faith and blind obedience, and comfort their hearts with the cold conſideration of an Indulgence, when yet the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and the blaſting, the cordial and yet confounding Truth of God in this ponit hath wrung (after a thouſand wranglings) that plain conſeſsion from a learned, but a bitter and violent Papiſt, that the Church by her Miniſterie and Magiſterie received of God doth cauſe us to believe: yet for all that, the very Reaſon wherefore we believe, is not the Church, but God ſpeaking in us: This is <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his third book of the Authority of the Scripture,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107154:108"/>
               <hi>cap.</hi> 12. And indeed when all is ſaid and done, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Teſtimony of Gods own Holy Spirit is ever able to miniſter true conſolation in believing. <hi>The God of peace it is</hi> that fils us with all peace and joy in believing, if we belive St. <hi>Paul'</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, cap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 13. But this is not meant of any private whiſper or <hi>Enthuſiaſus,</hi> (which is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) but of the ſpirits Teſtimony, joyned to his Holy Word in the clear evidence thereof, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ſpirit that God is become our Salvation: and I come to feel and know this of a certainty by Gods Power made perfect in my weakneſs, which I diſcern in finding his Holy fear rooted in my heart, and ſo fixt, that no ſtout words of prophane, nor incurſions, nor invaſious, nor ſeas of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming Corruptions in the examples of godleſs men about me can prevail over me to abandon my Religion, which is bottomed on my holy fear, and reverend thinking on his bleſſed Name.</p>
            <p>For (as I have ſaid) the mercy of our indulgent Father appears not only in tying this amulet to our own boſom, that every man is ſav'd by his own faith, and not another mans, bnt alſo in the manner of this ancorage; 'Tis his ſpecial Grace that my being Gods own is made deſcernable in the Light impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my own ſoul from his Word and Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I perceive the Covenant ſealed betwixt God and me in Chriſt Jeſus. But this is more wonderfull mercy ſtill, that my aſſurance and modeſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſalvation is faſtened by his Almighty Power, and ſo ſurely faſtened to ſo ſlender a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, ſo weak, and tender, and bruiſed reeds as my
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107154:109"/>Faith and fear are: for theſe two are to our purpoſe terms convertible. This fear in my Text hath Gold and Treaſure in it, and contains the precious nature of faith too, and diſcovers the ſame Efficacy and Properties of lively faith: ſo that he who poſſeſſes, or is bereft of it, is ſo of God himſelf; See for this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>This is an evil and bitter thing that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts; So he puts Fear for our whole Religion. So rare a Builder is that Lord of Heaven, that as he made the Heavens themſelves, and the earth of nothing, and hung ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> the earth in the midſt of the air upon juſt nothing: So in this mighty work of Grace, when I am afraid of not being faſt enough, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes that very fear the means of faſtning and confirmation, and anchors my aſſurance to my fear. Behold the unſearchable and unſpeakable riches of his mercy in this, that he forſakes not man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe he finds not in fleſh and blood the Pority of Angels, but as its ſaid to <hi>Levi, Mal.</hi> 2.5. <hi>My Covenant was with him of life and Peace,</hi> (and Life and Peace include all Bleſſings) <hi>and I gave them to him; For what?</hi> Obſerve it well; The free Grace of God in this exchange. I gave them to him, <hi>for the fear wherewith he feared me,</hi> and was afraid before my name: and juſt ſuch is the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance here of all this conſolation; for God hears and hearkens at <hi>verſe</hi> 16. and a book of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is written before him; for whom now all this, and ſor what? <hi>For them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name; and they ſhall be mine, for that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107154:109"/>I will love them for that inward teſtimony and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and that inward Teſtimony and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>ſhall aſſure them of my love.</hi> Is not this enough to make every one of us ſay, at parting hence, Well! <hi>I ſhall think the better of the fear of God as long as I live, for this Sermon:</hi> Do ſo in the name of God, and take this further reſolution with us; Never to liſten to the harſh and cruel doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> (which a man would think, were enough to throw down all the reſt of their building in unſtable ſoules; if thoſe ſouls would but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtay to think upon it; if they would not like unclean beaſts, ſtill ſwallow, and never chew the cud; and yet ſince it is fallen from them, they muſt, their Prieſts muſt by the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> all deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately maintain it, as if they were told openly by one of their own Doctors at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) and that is this, That God will never be ſo aſſured, never ſo contracted and eſpouſed to believers hearts in everlaſting love, but even after all their Merits, and Satisfactions, and Penances, and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, and Supererogations too, (Is it not ſtrange? conſidering how wide they open their Ark at firſt, and aſſure all clean and unclean beaſts that will come in of never periſhing;) Nay after all Pardons under the ſwelling ſeal, and all plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences (Is it not a miſerable caſe?) The wretched fluctuating Penitent after ablution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Unction, Abſolution, and all muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to die in diſcontent, and fall with horror and perplexity of Conſcience, and all his comfort in a little faint hope, that it is not wholly impoſſible for
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107154:110"/>him to get through long, and dreadfull purging flames at length to the joyes of heaven. But let us in Gods name ſtill continue to repoſe our ſouls on Chriſt, and reſting on this ground of comfort, in this appropriation, we ſhall find no reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hardly of him who is the <hi>Father of Mercies, and God of all conſolation,</hi> or impute a rigidneſs and tetrical ſowerneſs, or rather a tyrannous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapping us in inevitable damnation. To admit no ſuch jealouſies, and fears, and ſuſpitions of our Lord here, but wiſely learn to compound, and keep cloſe in conjunction that which God hath mixt and and put together: That is, a rejoycing in the Lord with trembling, a worſhip joined with godly fear, <hi>and joy in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> and ſo we may return from his ſervice as the women returned from his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre with fear and great joy.</p>

            </p>
            <p>WE are come to our ſecond part, the <hi>Proſpect,</hi> the day of our deliverance, and making up amongſt Gods Jewels; which day is fore-fold, 1. The day of puniſhing the ungodly, ſuch a day as ſome think is deſcribed here at <hi>cap.</hi> 4.1. In ſuch burning days the trial ſhall be made, and then God will reſolve this ſcruple here at <hi>verſe</hi> 17. twixt them that ſerve him, and ſuch as ſerve him not; and his Jewels in that day he will ſave: ſpare as a man ſpares his own ſon, as men incline to favour their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, and their Jewels and Treaſure above all their ſtuff of leſs value, as men in danger of ſhipwrack, reſerve a Jewel, though forced to unlade the ſhip of all her other burden; or as they catch away in times of war, or fire, or thieves. ſome precious thing above all other goods. And this renews the former conſolation, that to theſe Saints which excel in vertue, theſe precious Jewels, whoſe ſaith is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſaſtned on the moſt precious blood of Chriſt, belong all thoſe precious Promiſes of compaſſing, hiding, embracing, covering, relieving, defending, comforting, ſetting his eye, heart, ſoul upon them; of opening his ears and hearkning to their cries; of drawing near, helping, reſpecting, aſsiſting, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing, bleſſing, delivering by Protection, Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Coronation: and this no empty, but a real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort including all time. <hi>He hath, and doth, and will deliver us,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He hath done it to his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107154:111"/>ſervants in the evil day, in all their evil days of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Sickneſs, War, Plague, Famine, Priſon, Deluge of waters, or of ungodlineſs: So <hi>Noah</hi> was boxed up in his ark, riding on his horſe of wood over all the ſurges that devoured the world of the ungodly. So in the time of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and in the time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in our own land, when the waves of perſecution rouled high, and raged horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, God reſerved many Prophets in a cave by means of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> and many thouſands that bowed not the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> or were won to crouch to the Romiſh ſuperſtition, or ſhrink from the Reformed Religion. This is the mercy of God, that when ſometimes the wicked are ſwept away, as the houſe of a Spider, when the arrow flies by day, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by night, then comes out the Indulgence and Diſpenſation, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed; a thouſand ſhall fall before thee, and ten thouſand at thy right hand, Pſalm</hi> 91.7. Or if God do not ever in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique calamity give his own a temporal deliverance, for — <hi>Cadit &amp; Ripheus,</hi> yet he promiſes to redeem their ſoul from deceit and violence, <hi>and precious ſhall their death be in his ſight; Pſalm</hi> 72.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly. The day of making up theſe Jewels is underſtood by ſome, of the time of powerfull preaching of the Goſpel, principally when Chriſt himſelf and his fore-runner the Baptiſt entered on the office of converting the world: ſo much alſo is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here of that <hi>Sun of Rightcouſneſs, riſing with healing in his wings, &amp; his day-ſtar coming in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Eliah, cap.</hi> 4.2. And we find indeed the time of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107154:111"/>our Saviour called the time of Reformation; &amp; ſurely by that powerable Inſtrument of his Word it is that his Jewels are made up. <hi>John</hi> prepared the <hi>Way,</hi> and cleanſed the people by baptiſm to repentance, Chriſt wrought up many by himſelf, more by his Apoſtles after; St. <hi>Peter</hi> at one Sermon three thouſand, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five thouſand ſouls: And in that time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, thoſe Jewels were made bright, and manifeſt even to their Deſpiſers: See <hi>Anna, Elizabath, Zachary, Simeon,</hi> whom the curious <hi>Phariſees</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the baſe vulgar that knew not the Law; but they then were known for Jewels and the other for a generation of Vipers. Thus when the World in the Wiſdom thereof knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe, and to make what the world accounts weakneſs, his Power to ſalvation: For to this is aſcribed firſt the birth and breeding of theſe Jewels; For to which of the Angels ſaid God at any time, <hi>This day I have begotten thee?</hi> But as that ſpeech hath a natural Interpretation of Chriſt our elder Brother; ſo applyed to us in a ſupernatural, <hi>Of his own Will begat he us by the Word of Truth, Jam.</hi> 1.18. which is therefore ſtil'd <hi>the uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſeed,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. God makes thee (as he made this <hi>All</hi>) a work of power, but in recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, in producing Light of Chriſtianity, uſes his Word and Wiſdom to give thee form: ſo in the New Teſtament his Word precedes his Miracles; and the Donative to the Apoſtles firſt was, <hi>Fieri Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula ſcientiae;</hi> ſuch as enliven the Receivers; <hi>For man lives not by bread only;</hi> and for this cauſe, the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107154:112"/>Saints are called <hi>living ſtones,</hi> built on the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf the chief <hi>Corner-ſtone.</hi> Again, The word as it breeds and gives life, ſo Light, Grace and Luſtre. We cannot with the waxen wings of ſenſe or reaſon flie up to the Deity, not as revealed in Chriſt; and ripeneſs, and perfection, and rectifying of meer Reaſon gains us nothing: It loſes rather, and builds down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, diſcloſing the earthly Globe, and ſhutting up Heaven: Only God is able by the power of his word to take hold of our ſouls, and like ſo many keyes apply the graces of Faith, and Hope, and Love to the wards of prepared rational Nature: For the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is that which by original Purity, and perfect obedience, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in his death he hath acquired to and for all his members. But the noble Inſtrument to work that Grace a way into our ſouls, is the declaration of his Goſpel in uſe and Miniſtry of his Word. Yea the Scripture informs us of Illumination by this ſame means in the very Angels, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. But the pureſt Saints are all in darkneſs till this flaming light be held from heaven; no previous diſpoſition in the ſoul, no Platonick Recordation would ever bring us to the leaſt glympſe of ſalvation, were it not for this dew of Grace, which from the Word we drink into our underſtanding, and thereby direct our Wills, and even in their imaginations find it powerfull againſt all thoſe ſtarts and exorbitancies, reducing and bringing into Carptivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt Jeſus. For as health is the abſence of ſickneſs, and ſerenity nothing but
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107154:112"/>the avoidance of clouds and ſhadows; ſo the Word, where it comes, hath an innate and genuine proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſpel ſin, like <hi>Davids</hi> harp, driving out <hi>Sauls</hi> devil. You are clean (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>propter Sermonem,</hi> by reaſon of the Word; therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to rain, medicines, fonntains. Such an eager and piercing operation, and oppoſition as it pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the cloſeſt ſin, and is a Diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; ſo <hi>Magdalens</hi> whoredom and neſt of Devils diſlodged; <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſwoln to a Camels groſſeneſs, abated to the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a thred, fit to be drawn through the eye of a Needle, fit to enter into the kingdom of Heaven; with this was <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart opened; all other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances but charms, or holy water. This mighty word of ſtones able <hi>to raiſe up children unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> this the double edged <hi>ſword</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> this the fire, and the hammer, and file to frame and work out Gods Jewels from the rough, till piece by piece God thereby hath removed thoſe ruines which through <hi>Adams</hi> fall, oppreſt all humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hid away the primitive beauty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our ſouls. Laſtly, 'Tis this that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms from Prophaneſs. Rebellion, Hypocriſie, and purges the moſt diſſolute: <hi>Were with ſhall a young man reform?</hi> of all other the moſt difficult; <hi>by taking heed according to thy Word;</hi> and then this Word it is which adorns, and teaches how to hang about the neck and ears of Gods holy ones, all thoſe ſhinning graces of precious Faith, and Hope, and Charity, and Meekndſs, and heavenly-Mindedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:107154:113"/>And therefore in our paſſage, are we not to take notice of this? I ſay, we both Preachers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; we firſt as Jewellers, to ſever the precious from the vile; if ſpeak, to ſpeak as the words of God, and yet to furniſh themſelves with all helps of learning; the better to inſinuate by Similes and riches of diſcourſe, and ſo to raiſe the imagination, and fill the underſtandings of their hearers: but above all, it points directly at the curioſity of our pains and carefull induſtry, to be work-men, needing not to be aſhamed. They muſt be work-men indeed that dcal with Jewels, ſpecially with cuting them to the life and perfect beauty, and faſhioning them in all their points, <hi>that the man of God may be perfect, lacking nothing.</hi> Alas! if the unprofitable ſervant be caſt out, what ſhall become of the Malignant, the Covetous, the Proud, the Luxurious? How are we then to think of that triple charge of <hi>Paſce,</hi> of <hi>Jacobs</hi> enduring froſt and heat, of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards keeping watch by night, and then of <hi>Leo Rugiens,</hi> to devour both Paſtor and Flock? And how are they able to reſiſt, if we aſſiſt not, unleſs we exhort, rebuke, exhort and miniſter a word <hi>of</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to every ſoul that is weary? and then the people to be ſwift to hear. How precious is the treaſure we bring, though in earthen veſſels! Is it not the Word of God we bring and offer you? To mens words we owe temporary belief, (<hi>if</hi> they ſpeak wiſely) and a Reſignation of our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till we hear them out. But to the Word <hi>of God,</hi> which is diffuſed into a Sermon, (or elſe woe to him that makes it) we owe an abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107154:113"/>and perpetual captivity. Take heed then of contempt or wanton ranging after an heap of ſuch Teachers as are after our own luſts, leſt we cauſe God to withold this bread from Heaven, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the famiſhing of our ſouls! Let <hi>England</hi> remember the error of the Jewiſh Church once the Jewel and peculiar of the Lord of Hoſts, the defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> the Degeneration, and then the demolition and abolition of <hi>Antioch, Epheſus, Corinth,</hi> and many others: O think in time (for we draw very near it) of this peoples ſin here at the twelfth and thirteenth verſes, <hi>They held the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord contemptible, and ſnuffed at it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance reſpecting the gorgeous Idols of the Gentiles:</hi> In the ſame corrupt affection as many carnal Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers not aſhamed to let men hear their wiſhes for the ſtately and triumphant ſhews again of <hi>Maſſe, Dirges,</hi> Proceſſions, Pilgrimages. God hath bleſt the Land and Church, even to the ſtupor and envy of our Neighbours, with abundance of the Goſpel of peace, and the bleſſing of God in his Ordinance, and with many curious and exact work-men, Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſouls; and will we not bleſs the Lord, praiſe him and magnifie him for ever? Will we not prize this unſearchable Riches of Chriſt? Shall we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrive to quench, and do deſpite to the Spirit of his Grace by deſpiſing Prophecying, and like Swine and Dogs trample upon, and turning again rend and tear ſuch as pour theſe precious Pearls before us; ſtoning them that are ſent unto us, with hard and bitter cenſures? If the miniſtration of the Law was glorious, what is that of the Goſpel?
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107154:114"/>Examine it; Is it not the Power and Wiſdom of God? and in the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament, is not the bread we break the communion of the body, and the cup we reach out into you from God, the communion of the blood of Jeſus? Are not the offices of the Church, ſuch as diſtinguiſh us from Dogs and Infidels? Let me then firſt creep a little into mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> and bitterly curſe all thoſe thas have evil will at <hi>Sion,</hi> and then flie into <hi>Geri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi> and cheerfully bleſs with bleſſings of the right band; Praiſe, and Honor, and Salvation upon the heads of all thoſe Chriſtian Kings, Princes and people of all conditions, who in their ſeveral places ſeek the advancement of the Truth of God, and the encouragement of his faithfull ſervants; while their own hearts ſtrike them with the conſcience and guilt of maliciouſneſs, and propenſeneſs to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or ſchiſmatick Innovations, that dare not ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We come briefly to the third day, (to which we muſt all come) the day of death; when Gods own having paſt the fervor of youth, and clean eſcaped the fleſh, and worlds contagions, and the fiery darts of Satan, having in ſhort done what they came for, they deſcend into the grave with their bodies, like a rick of corn into the Barn in due ſeaſon, and their ſpirits return to God that gave them, when even death is to them precious, as well for reſt and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as for that new Newneſs of life which then begins in death, clearing to them that whereof <hi>Euripides</hi> doubted, whether to die were indeed to live; and contrary; for ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> determines it,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107154:114"/>
               <hi>Chriſt is to me life, and death is to me advantage,</hi> and therefore deſired he this day of his diſſolution, wherein he might be more perfectly united to his Jeſus. For theſe his holy Jewels are never ſo well ſet, as when inſet in the joy and Glory of their Lord and Maſter, which makes that in ſuch ſouls, even the approaching towards death, fils and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies with high and heavenly apprehenſions: as it is in natural motions, nearer ſtill to the center, or as in Diggers in a Myne, who work moſt earneſtly, when near the Treaſure. But if it happen that any of theſe Jewels be ſo far dignified as his Lord accepts his life in ſacrifice by Martyrdome conſummate, in ſealing the Truth of Jeſus with his blood, how doth this add freſh ornament and addition of honor to theſe Servants of God? as came to paſs with that Protomartyr St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> firſt made up a Jewel after his Maſter; thoſe ſtones the Perſecutors threw, ſurrounding his head as a precious Crown of Glory: However they are all that die in the Lord enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed from thoſe chains of corruption, which abide the beſt alive; for we dare not boaſt our Saints as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth <hi>Gouraga,</hi> or his Fellow doth <hi>Phil. Nerius,</hi> who was fain to pray God to depart from him, and draw back his mind from heavenly things. No, we have learnt another way of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgement from St. <hi>Paul, I know that in me,</hi> that is, in my fleſh <hi>dwels no good thing;</hi> and St. <hi>James, In many things, we ſin all,</hi> and the day of abſolute abſolution from ſin is not till this day of diſſolution, wherein theſe Jewels by death come to take poſſeſſion of everlaſting life.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:107154:115"/>4. The laſt, is the laſt of dayes, <hi>Noviſſimus,</hi> and the day of Renovation, which none but the ancient of days can know, and of which alſo there is a mixt mention in the beginning of this fourth chapter, <hi>The day of the Lord comes as a furnace.</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. <hi>The great day of his wrath, called the day of the Lord Jeſus, and the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 16. <hi>The firſt day we ſpake on, the day of affliction, and the laſt we ſpake on, the day of death,</hi> do roule up ſometime all together: It befals alike (ſaith the Preacher) to the clean and unclean, to him that ſwears, and to him that fears an oath; and for the ſecond, the day of powerfull preaching the word, <hi>Hypocrites</hi> elude it: <hi>The devil can transform himſelf into an Angil of Light,</hi> and his zanies may make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, ſaith the Scripture. But at this great day ſhall be a real Partition of Sheep and Goats, of Wheat and Tares, which yet flock and grow together; then he will gather his elect from the four winds, and declare his mighty Power in glorifying both their ſouls and bodies, both the Jewel and the Cabinet; both which, at that reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of God (when he appears) ſhall alſo appear with him in glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall the aſſociation then of the body be (as it may ſeem,) any diminution of glory to the ſoul; For firſt, The School reſolves it, that though the ſoul ſeparate may ſeem more to reſemble God, and therefore happier; yet joined, it hath the nearer Reſemblance, having <hi>eſſe perfectius,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then more perfect: As in the heart, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107154:115"/>is motion, doth therefore more reſemble, God when moved, then when quieſcent, though God never move as all. Secondly, Though vertue ſevered from matter be <hi>Potention,</hi> and ſo <hi>Faelictor</hi> in abſolute ſpeech, yet not ſo in ſuch vertue as hath a nature and property to be in matter. Thirdly, Even in the Act of Underſtanding, the glorious body ſhall be adjuvant to the ſpirit; for as much as the glorified Body will cauſe the ſoul more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to produce her operations; and ſo the good redounding to the body in Glory, ſhall inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſerve to the ſouls perfection, as <hi>Aniſtotle</hi> ſaith, external goods, inſtrumentally contribute to his felicity in the action of vertue. Laſtly, Though the ſoul have fulneſs of delight in God, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive addition by the body joyned, which is but finite, where God is infinite Goodneſs; yet <hi>extenſive</hi> they ſay, it ſhall avail <hi>ad plus,</hi> though not <hi>ad majus;</hi> and <hi>Intenſive</hi> too for the reaſon aforeſaid, becauſe then the operation of the ſoul, whereby ſhe is born towards her enjoying of God, ſhall be made more perfect, being in her own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate: This is meant by that <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6. <hi>Lord, how long?</hi> and ſo much is arguable from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of pain in the damned, which ſhall be then augmented. And again, Though this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Body weigh down the immortal ſoul, yet the glorious body ſhall be more compliant, when all that ſhall be removed whereby there is any relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance made to the ſouls actions, as finally it ſeems moſt of all clear by that gracious invitement of Chriſt Jeſus at that day, <hi>Enter into thy Maſters joyce</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:107154:116"/>So that in this day, theſe Jewels are wholly refined, and purified, and beautified with Salvation, as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 149. For then, as if they were made up into one chain with God, and ſo many ſtones in a Bracelet, <hi>God ſhall be all in all,</hi> above all, and through all, and in them all. When the pure Bride, the wife of the Lamb, ſhall have the Glory of God, and her Light like unto a ſtone moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, even like a <hi>Jaſper,</hi> clear as Chriſtal; <hi>O how glorious things are ſpoken of thee, thou City of God!</hi> and how great Riches haſt thou reſerved for them that <hi>love thee!</hi> For of their very bodies, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture witneſſeth that they ſhall ſhine as the Sun, and like unto the glorious body of Chriſt Jeſus himſelf: And what do the Fathers and School-men comment upon the Subtilty, Impaſſibility, Agility, and Clarity, and Incorruptibility, but for the Soul, into what a glorious liberty of the ſons of God ſhe enters, and exceeding that of Paradiſe, which was <hi>poſſe non peccare?</hi> But this <hi>Noviſſima,</hi> this Power ſhall be <hi>Non poſſe peccare,</hi> an impoſſibility of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any more for ever. When there ſhall be no further need of working by that bleſſed Engine, the Word of God, <hi>Verbum Domini,</hi> but we ſhall ſweetly enjoy <hi>Verbum Domini,</hi> that Lord who is the Eternal Word, the Wiſdom increated; when there ſhall be no longer ſacrifice, becauſe no expiation; no more <hi>Sacraements,</hi> but <hi>Res ipſae:</hi> Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves preſented us, the ſubſtance and thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Here the Saints are fed with the leaves, but there with the very fruits of that Tree of Life; and all theſe endleſs in that incomprehenſible Viſion
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107154:116"/>of the Almighty; for there Felicitie begins and ends. As in Philoſophy, they that made it conſiſt and reſt in Con templation of Forms ſeparate, do add this reaſon, becauſe ſouls do <hi>emanare,</hi> do flow from thence; So is God <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt.</hi> The beginning of our bleſſedneſs is to proceed from him, to be his Off-ſpring and Generation; and the laſt Reſolution is that Fruition, Viſion, Union with him, an Union ſo high, as no tongue of Man or Angel, no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can reach it, no thought of mans heart can aſcend unto it. For though the ocular Viſion of God ſhall be terminate only in his Saints, and in beholding the perſon of Chriſt Jeſus, in whom the fulneſs of the God-head dwels bodily; yet the Intellectual Cognition ſhall pierce into the Eſſence of the Almighty: For we ſhall ſee him face to face, ſee him as he is, and know, even as we are known. To make a delightfull Knowledge, there are three things requiſite. 1. The ſenſible or underſtanding Faculty. 2. The Object; and 3. The Union: And by how much apter and abler that apprehending Power is, the Object more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the manner of uniting more inward, ſtill the more delight. Now all theſe are here <hi>per</hi> and <hi>ſuper-tranſcendent;</hi> Firſt, The Underſtanding now not alone above ſenſe, but beyond it ſelf in Purity and Glory. Secondly, The Object, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> it ſelf, and in abſtract. Thirdly, The way of Combination, an open and clear Viſion, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the whole mind of the Beholder. If ſounds and colors ſtrike the ſenſes, even to a raviſhing;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107154:117"/>O what a heavenly kiſs, and ſpiritual Embrace ſhall that be, when after a world of fears, and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhings, and longings incident even to this caeleſtial Love, we come to interminable Acquieſcence, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and Appetite perpetually interchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able!

            <p>We have found his Office, but will <hi>God</hi> perform it? 'Tis a Queſtion of mens performing their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a Queſtion too of falſe gods. They had an Idol in <hi>Egypt,</hi> cal'd by ſuch a name, <hi>Baal-Zephon, Dominus ſpeculae,</hi> Lord of the Watch-tower, to fright their fugitives; but when <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſt that way, and pitched the Camp there; this god was aſleep, but he that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Iſrael neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps.</hi> He kept his Iſrael then and ſince; he made good the Title then and ſince, and dare we queſtion it now? But how doth <hi>God</hi> viſit? Search the Scriptures, they teſtifie of him; thoſe books are moral to teach <hi>Man</hi> his office, the whole duty of <hi>Man,</hi> to make the <hi>Man of God perfect</hi> to every good work: but they are Hiſtorical too, and Prophetical too, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing us what God hath done, and what God will do. Look then to thoſe Records, and we ſhall find what, and when, and how in his ſeveral Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations. His Viſitations are his actions; Action is from intrinſique vertue; Vertue there is none ſuch in God as ſuppoſes Infirmity or Imperfection, as Faith, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſuch as argues Perfection, Mercy, Juſtice, Wiſdom Bounty, Power. According with theſe, we find his Viſits: Firſt, In general, then with reference to men, both wayes, their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107154:119"/>perſons in mercy, ſin upon their perſons in Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general, in all places, and over all things above. Heaven is his Throne, where he overlooks the Orders and royal Armies of his Angels, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, deſcending; in the material Heaven, diſpoſing that numberleſs variety of thoſe glorious ſtars, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them all by their names; in the airie Heaven amidſt thoſe flocks of Fowl, his Providence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the fall of every little ſparrow. If we go down to the ſea amongſt thoſe infinite ſhoals and innumerable fiſhes, there we ſee his Wonders in the <hi>Deep;</hi> or if we go deeper, if we deſcend to hell, <hi>He is there alſo,</hi> binding the fury of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal ſpirits: And for the Earth, it is his <hi>foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool;</hi> unmov'd he ſits in midſt of Heaven, and yet they be the eyes of the Lord that run to and fro through the whole earth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.10. raigning above, yet containing and upholding all below; compaſſing all about, yet piercing all within.

            <p>We may not omit his mercifull Viſitation; ſhould it not ſhew like a piece of ingratitude not to touch here firſt, though our voyage be to that of final Judgement? And the firſt particular of his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full viſitation (wherein is his delight) is confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as man is a body. God then did viſit him in the houſe of duſt, as his laſt work will be joyning and refining the ſame duſt again in Glory, and what might be ſaid of his viſitation in the womb? — <hi>Thou ſaweſt my ſubſtance being yet imperfect, &amp;c.</hi> What of all thoſe wheels and wyers within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that Mill and Clock of his contriving? of his winding up; at thought of which, <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks with a kind of ſtrange ſhuddering, <hi>O Lord, I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi> What of mans Shape, Speech.

            <p>Secondly, As <hi>Man</hi> is a Chriſtian by means of the Revelation of Jeſus, that <hi>Orient ex Alto, — The day-ſpring from on High hath viſited. — Luke</hi> 1. <hi>that Sun which riſeth with healing in his wings:</hi> And this was, and is a bleſſed Viſitation; for thus it runs, — <hi>Viſited and Redeemed his people.</hi> Himſelf did viſite, and his ſervants did it in his name, riſing early for early viſitation; and ſince his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he ſend by his Apoſtles, Paſtors and Teachers, that heavenly Treaſure in their earthen veſſels, this Manna, this Light, <hi>the glory of his people Iſrael;</hi> and becauſe that had not concerned us, <hi>it is alſo a Light revealed to the Gentiles;</hi> this revives us, when he is ſaid <hi>To viſit the Gentiles alſo, to take of them a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his Name, Acts</hi> 15.14. But not that word of Grace, though the Word of Life, and Power, and Mighty in operation; Not all thoſe gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, thoſe Letters of Love indited by the Holy Ghoſt in Proſe and Verſe, which cry unto us <hi>to turn and look upon, and accept the ſalvation profered;</hi> that ſalvation which our bleſſed Saviour wrought for us by ſtrong cryes, and by the effuſion of that blood which yet cryes and intercedes freſhly for us; not all theſe availab, letill the third viſitation of his Spirit, which is therefore called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> Coming as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends in viſitation, both to mourn and comfort him. Nay, what Viſitant, what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, what Confeſſor, what Wiſe of thy boſom,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107154:120"/>what Friend, who is as thine own ſoul, would ſo attend? for he abides for ever; So miniſter, (for he helps, <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Mans</hi> office in regard of this mercifull viſitation, it, to debate and anſwer. Debate firſt, Think what we were before he viſited; Loſt, Captives, Enemies, <hi>Dead in ſins and treſpaſſes.</hi> — He then to drop his Blood and Grace, his manifold Grace preventing, exciting, guiding, confirming, ſoftly pierceing even into ſtony hearts, which is deſcribed by many a ſweet and amorous Metaphor.

            <p>But what ſhall we do? Firſt Believe, elſe we make <hi>God a lyar,</hi> and there's the quarrel, when we tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon, deſpiſe and count the blood of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107154:121"/>as an unholy thing: and if we tremble to contemn him, ſhall we dare to think it nothing? Shall we take a ſolemn Pride in deſpiſing his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Et eo nomine,</hi> even therefore hold a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable becauſe a Miniſter? Remember it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as the height and Precipice of all iniquity, as far as people could do, or God could ſuffer, when God riſing early by them, was mockt in them; the Text ſaith then there was no remedy, 2 <hi>Chron. ult. cap.</hi> But again Debate, What ſhall we do? and the Apoſtle meets this Conſultation, <hi>Make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> and this to be done in Gods Method: Enquire after our Calling firſt, and not begin at the wrong end. Hearken to that cry of the Spirit within thy ſoul, the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is within you, and not too fondly ſpend the time in ſearching thoſe rouls of Gods predeſtination; and take heed of ſinking thy ſoul toward a deſpair in his Mercy, or to a ſelf-condemnation: For the Spirit of God ſpeaking peace, dareſt thou ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a War? Or if <hi>God</hi> have no bill againſt thee, ſhall thy timerous Conſcience be framing vain and carnal Anſwers? Doth not <hi>God</hi> ask by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, Where is the bill of thy mothers divorce, or to which of my Creditors have I ſold thee? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 50.1.</p>
            <p>If ſo, Then what ſhall I anſwer? anſwer God in obedience, all the Creatures preach this Anſwer: there is in all a Correſpondency. The Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, hear us; and the Earth hears them; and the Heavens hear it: but all hear him, even the moſt unruly Creatures are our Rule, the ſtormy wind and Tempeſt obeying his voice. So we,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107154:121"/>his Voyce without in his Word, and his Voyce too within by his Spirit ſpeaking to our hearts; not then drown thoſe motions, or bury them in company, and wine, and worldly cares, or pleaſures, leſt ſo we quench, grieve, or do deſpight to the Spirit of grace; and obey him actually, not in profeſſory Religion only, but walk in light, and bring forth fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy amendment of life.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>quid retribuam?</hi> what anſwer but a grateful admiration, as he that ſpake after a full apprehenſion, O Lord, <hi>what is man that thou doſt ſo viſit him?</hi> This ſacrifice, as he counts it an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſo tis all we can offer, all we can offer him on earth; and when all things here have end, endleſs thanks ſhall have their beginning in Heaven. As that Church in triumph there, all thoſe Angels, and all thoſe Virgins, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, with their loud clarious and Trumpets, and Harps of Gold and Ivory, ſtrike nothing, ſing nothing but <hi>Hallelujah:</hi> So we that are parts of the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, ſhould exalt our voyces and joyn in full <hi>Chorus. We praiſe thee GOD, we acknowledge</hi> — &amp;c. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall thus be full of his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods ſecond Viſitation is in Judgement: and for ſin general.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107154:122"/>reaches his ſervants, his choiſeſt, though with limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with that diſtinction ever, <hi>ad correctionem, non a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For is there not a ſwarm, an hydra, and wheel of troubles in our whole life? <hi>per caput &amp; circa ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liunt latus,</hi> (ſaith he) when roſe the Sun ſo fair, but ere his fall ſome clouds have ſeiz'd on them, if not on him ſome grief? ſome, nay many, many perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, enough I'le warrant thee; for I have Gods own teſtimony, <hi>enough for the day is the evil thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Viſitation when it drops, when it falls, when it pours on us, what ſhall we do? Why, firſt debate; ſtand and conſider as <hi>Job,</hi> if all ſhould go: <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked muſt I return.</hi> Is it the height, the depth of any grievous affliction? What is it more then that of my Saviour? O but he was more then man; is it more then theirs in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>rackt ſawn aſunder?</hi> &amp;c. Haſt thou yet reſiſted to blood, or is it come to the fiery tryal? And then in affliction, at leaſt after it, ask thy ſoul, is it not <hi>good for thee?</hi> Heb. 11.2. as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>ſtrangers, may not a man this way receive Angels unawares?</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Jacob</hi> on his journey at <hi>Bethel,</hi> when he wak'd and ſaid, <hi>ſurely God is in this place:</hi> ſo God is in this Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I was not aware. I took at firſt no notice of his Fatherly corrections, which are indeed his compaſſions and conſolations; <hi>Thy Rod and thy ſtaff comfort me, Pſalm</hi> 23. But now I feel his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit me is like his viſiting the earth, which he viſits and enriches, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 65. like a Phyſitians viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107154:122"/>an Hoſpital, to cure; for if I am ſure it is the hand of my God; I am ſure alſo that it is in Love, <hi>for God is Love,</hi> tis his Eſſence immutable. No reaſon then his viſitation ſhould prove to an irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſadneſs, or a melancholy, a dejection, a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, a diffidence. So long as the work is his, though he purge or cut, ſo he give me not over, ſo he caſt me not out of his hands, ſo I hear not that voyce which is more dreadfull then ten thouſand thunders, Depart from me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I am to debate what I am to anſwer in affliction. Surely the beſt anſwer is no anſwer at all. <hi>Tacui Domine,</hi> and my ſoul kept ſilence, not as unaffected, remorſeleſs, but as ſubdued by faith, repentance, obedience, working me to a bleſſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; captivating and bringing into ſubjection eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exorbitant, every wild and wandring imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Once have I ſpoken</hi> (ſaith holy <hi>Job</hi>) but <hi>I will no more:</hi> or if my heart will vent, I have forms and molds ready wherein to caſt my words; that of <hi>Ely, It is the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>David, behold, here am Is let him do unto me as it ſeems good in his own eyes:</hi> and I will confeſs too, to his glory, the fruit and the root; <hi>I find that thou, O Lord, of very faithfulneſs, haſt cauſed me to be troubled,</hi> Pſalm 119. <hi>and thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation hath preſerved my ſpirit,</hi> Job 10.12. And to draw this into practice in each particular afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for every one is Gods Embaſſadour, and none to be diſmiſs'd, unanſwered. The application is a world of matter, which I cannot look at now: only for that I find my ſelf in a Seminary, in a Colledge of Divines, I may have the liberty, the recreation too, to make for you and my ſelf one particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107154:123"/>For we (my Brethren) that are or ſhould be <hi>pars indocili melior grege,</hi> if your pulſe beat like mine, are certainly ſo much infeſted with no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calamity, as when <hi>ſaevit malignum, &amp; ignobile vulgus,</hi> as when we find our ſelves diſgrac'd, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeum of thoſe that are indeed the ſcum of the world; when all we can ſay or do, which way ſoever we frame our doctrine or converſation, it is as water ſpilt upon the ground. For though we pipe unto them, they will not dance; though we mourn, they will not weep. Let a mans behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our be like <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, rough, auſtere, they cry <hi>he hath a Devil:</hi> or if enlarged in freedom of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, like our Saviour, <hi>away with him, a glat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, &amp; a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and ſinners.</hi> So that the ground of the quarrel reſts not in being thus or thus affected, or qualified, or endowed, but they hate us for our very calling. But what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer have we? I could tell you one, a harſh one, of the Cynical Philoſopher, who being demanded, How it happened that the great and wealthy people affected rather to be liberal in rewarding Fools, and Players, and Jeſters, and beggers then men of his profeſſion? anſwered, for that they might perchance have ſome hope of proving ſuch themſelves, but no hope of turning Scholars. This was bitter: But we have learn'd a better of the Apoſtle, I paſs not to be judged by you; and a better yet of a better maſter, Let not your hearts be troubled: they called our Maſter Belzebub, and <hi>ſhall not I drink of the cup which my father gives me?</hi> (ſaith he) ſo, ſhall we not drink the potion which our Lord hath begun to us, which by taſting firſt, he hath ſweetened for
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107154:123"/>us? Is the Diſciple greater? ſo, is he daintier then his Maſter? Were we like the Apoſtles perſecuted, whipt, impriſon'd? that conſideration would make us march on in all theſe dificulties; and like hardy ſouldiers, <hi>non gementes ſequi Imperatorem;</hi> But rather rejoycing that we were counted worthy to ſuffer any thing for his name ſake: and if it came to death, we know our Anſwer, <hi>Chriſt ts to me life; and death is to me advantage.</hi> But I forget my ſelf; for I am bound to a further Port, to that which is appointed after death; for after that to Judgement: <hi>When God ſhall viſit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this final Judgement, the Text informs us two Things. It ſhall be, and it ſhall be moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: therefore needs debating, and caſting for our Anſwer. Firſt it ſhall be, <hi>He will viſit;</hi> Even the Heathen had an Apprehenſion, an expectance of ſuch a day, a time <hi>quo Mare, quo Tellus, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta<expan>

This is more; The title of our ſouls, and eternal ſalvation is at trial: a Debt doubled and re-doubled, in ſins of Youth, of Age, of Ignorance, of Preſumption; and are our Purſes neerer then our ſouls? But is there no avoiding?

What words ſhall I chuſe? ſaith he, <hi>Job</hi> 9.15. Alas! all thought of anſwer then will be in vain, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that we are not able to anſwer him one thing of a thouſand: that day is his day, his day of wrath; the time of mercy is over, paſt, irrevocably paſt; his day of Doom is come, 'tis come to ſentence, and therefore what ſhall we do? Why? while we have time, put in our anſwer; yet the Chancery and Court of Requeſt is open. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation. My Text is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yet, <hi>He ſhall come, he ſhall viſit.</hi> Here is a latitude for Repentance; yet he expects, calls for our anſwer, and we know to what: we have his Bill, his Articles, Interrogatories, that is, his Law written, and engraven in our hearts: we muſt now frame, and put in our anſwer: What is it?</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Repentance</hi> firſt, For ſo may that of the Apoſtle be underſtood in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. where he enjoyns the Chriſtian ſouldier to have his feet ſhod with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Goſpel of peace: I know ſome take that preparation of the Goſpel for a readineſs to preach that Goſpel; which ſhould then belong alone to us Miniſters; others for a promptneſs in profeſſion; others Evangelical Obedience; and ſome take it to be Patience, and not unlikely. But may it not alſo endure this meaning of Repentance too? conſidering it is made the firſt ſtep in the way of Life, and ſo the firſt entrance into the field againſt Satan; by <hi>John</hi> firſt, the day-ſtar, who roſe before the Sun, and came to prepare the way: How? <hi>Repent, &amp;c.</hi> And our Saviour in the ſame mind upon the ſame Text, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven it at hand.</hi> Sad ſighs, and prayers, and tears make up the firſt part of Repentance, and make up ſo the ſacrifice of a broken and contrite heart, <hi>which God will not deſpiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And haſt thou this? Is the rock cloven? Come drops of warm blood in anguiſh from thy heart? Break there floode of bitter weeping from thine eyes? This is a fair piece of an anſwer. Such tears have a voice that reaches Heaven; and not from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> only, <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but from <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> too, a fearfull ſinner; becauſe thou haſt wept before me, I have heard it. 'Tis Muſick to the Almighties-ſelf, and raiſes a joy in Heaven.

Was I not ſtung by this Serpent, drowned in this ſea, miſerably ſchorcht by this fire, envenomed in the whole Maſs of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with this corruption before I was born? And ſince, alas! I have added to this Ocean, put fewel to this fire, help to infix this ſting, and work into my heart the contagion; and then am I able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve againſt ſin, to deny ungodlineſs, to reject the Tempter, to give my luſts their final anſwer? I find indeed natural men, moral men, when they will compound an happy man, put inthis one ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, <hi>Reſponſare cupidinibus, &amp; ſibi imperioſus,</hi> enabling him to check and controul, to command and ſubdue rebellious Paſsions by the dictates of rectified Reaſon: and their ſeveral anſwers to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe corrupt affections, are enough to ſhame me,

What to hate ſin ſo as I ought, with a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred? I flie ſome enormous vices for fear of Laws. But <hi>Tolle periclum, Jam vaga proſiliet, &amp;c.</hi> And though I know there is death in the Pot, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin is no better; though I pull the fruit and taſte it, and prove it to be nought but Gall and Bitterneſs, nay barrenneſs and ſhame; yet ſuch is my madneſs, to purſue a new ſhame, and ſeek death in the error of life; falling like a Bird or a Beaſt: Nay, no brid, no beaſt would ſo oft fall into the ſame ſnare, ſame pit, into the ſame ſin, whereof I have again, and again repented me.</p>
            <p>What then ſhall I do? Shall I rely on my ſecond anſwer, and truſt in my own righteouſneſs?

But Lord I find the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> thy holy Word, and the cries of thy holy ſervants far otherwiſe.

In mens conſultings and reſolvings for worldly affairs, they may, they do uſually miſ-count, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; fortune choaks their artillery: But in theſe holy proviſions, the end is ever gracious, ſucceſs
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107154:127"/>glorious.

He that made them wonder at his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anſwers, and to whom no man was able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a word. Who was that, and where is he to be had? If any man ſin, any man that finds himſelf a ſinner, Let him put his anſwer to this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate: for we have him, ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> we have an Advocate, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous: He is the Propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Take then thy ſhield of faith, and quench all the fiery darts of the devil. This is the new and living way of anſwering God, by his Son, by the blood of <hi>Jeſus, Hebrews</hi> 10. May not then the Chriſtian Believer have acceſs with boldneſs? For ſhall both bleed for ſin, or ſhall he bleed in vain? <hi>Peccavi peccatum grande,</hi> ſaith he, I have committed an hainous ſin: yet on my Faith and Repentance, I will go to God, and ſay, <hi>Lord thou canſt have but Blood, Merit, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Satisfaction, exact Obedience.</hi> Take then thy Son Jeſus; He is all theſe, and all theſe to me: for he is mine, I receive him by faith, and I find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, hope, lively hope, full aſſurance in him. I will not therefore flie with <hi>Cain,</hi> and cry with him, <hi>My ſin is greater;</hi> No, thy mercy rejoyces againſt ſin; and now therefore <hi>there is no condemnation to them that be in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> My anſwer then to thy Bill, is, it was torn, when his body was torn; it is cancelled, and was nailed to his Croſs: My debt was
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107154:128"/>great, but is paid to the utmoſt farthing. Thy wrath, let it be a cup, he hath drunk it of; Let it be more, a whole Wine-preſs, he hath trode it alone. I will then put on my Lord Jeſus, and come in the rayment of my elder Brother, and be roab'd in his innocency, and canſt thou then deny me? No, thou canſt not, thou mayeſt as well deny thy ſelf: For if I have it fair to ſhew under thy own hand: Every gracious Promiſe in thy Goſpel is ſuch; yea, this was thine own Act in my ſalvation: <hi>For God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> But may I not prodigally and preſumptuouſly fling away my ſoul in a vain confidence of Mercy? Yes, many do ſo; that will do nothing themſelves, not when they have the aſſiſtance and proffer of help from Heaven. Therefore I will compound, and put all theſe anſwers together. I will truſt to my Saviours merit: But I will repent too, and pray too, and work too, and ſo work out mine own ſalvation with fear and trembling. And though I have no Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mine own; and without it no ſeeing thee at the Day of Judgement, yet thou the God of my peace wilt ſanctifie me againſt that day. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. O bleſſed and full anſwer now! and O bleſſed condition of ſuch happy ſouls, ſo far from affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at thought of the Judges coming, that they ſhall then rejoyce, and lift up their faces; and in the mean time, are of the number and communion of thoſe Saints that love his appearing, looking for, and haſting to the comming of their Lord in glory, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and crying, <hi>Bow the Heavens, and come down;</hi> and <hi>Lord, how long?</hi> And <hi>come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:107154:128"/>I have done with the explication of my Text. There is a fourfold application. Firſt, In general, to the Land and State, whereof we are a part: God hath performed his office of a Viſitor over us, both wayes: In Mercy; Thus long preſerving us, and extending peace over us as a flood, even then when it hath been a Sea, a red Sea of blood and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine round about us. Viſiting us in his vigilancy, and defeating our enemies blaſted attempts, in 88, in the Powder-Treaſon; Giving us ſtrange and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous deliverances: amongſt them not the leaſt, the bringing back our preſent Royal Soveraign from the hand and land of his enemies. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wayes hath this holy Watcher from his Circle and Seat of Heaven viſited us, and kept us under his wings of gracious Providence? And if he had not, would not our foes by this have rooted out our name from under Heaven, and the name of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants been no more in remembrance? for wanted there either Might or Malice in them? hoping and projecting oft to have made our land like <hi>Sodom,</hi> clouds of Pitch, and heaps of Aſhes? But the ſnare harh been hitherto ſtill broken, and we yet delivered by his gracious and mercifull viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That ſecond way of viſiting in Judgement, the Lord hath alſo of late begun to trie among us, by that plague, which ſwept away ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and by the loud and dreadfull ſound of War in Neighbour-countries, that have really taſted, and actually endured all that Prophetical deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The noiſe of weapons, rowling of Garments in blood, ſpoiling their houſes, raviſhing their wives and Virgins, and breaking their Children in pieces
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107154:129"/>before their eyes; And theſe things befaln ſuch as deſerve from us a tender and dear reſpect, we being wounded through their ſides; or if theſe accidents beyond the water, will not waken us God hath his way in the Sea, (ſaith the Scripture) and we might have markt his dealing with us there; for a long time being able to do no good there, and our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies able to do us much miſchief from thence; God hath his way in the earth and under it, and we have felt him there, ſenſibly perceived his mighty hand from thence; in the ayr he hath his path too, and <hi>walks upon the wings of the wind,</hi> and there he cauſ'd thoſe rotten vapours to blend themſelves into a peſtilent defluxion, and pour their virulence on the earth. And if we take into conſideration the preſent bravery of the enemy abroad, and our home-diviſions, our great boughs beating one againſt another, no man that is not extreamly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, but will eaſily find that God is angry with his people, and that our ſins deſerve the haſtening of the laſt Judgement, in the other Element of violent fire. And then <hi>what manner of men ought we to be</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in holy converſation?</hi> How? watch, pray, and ſtrive to anſwer him reſpectively to theſe Viſitations. But alas, for his merciful vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation have we been reſponſible ſo much as in thankfulneſs? O no, it is our national ſin. Secure ingratitude wherein we ſleep and dream away our lives without remembrance of that gracious God, — <hi>qui nobis hac otia fecit,</hi> who hath ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us. And to his Summons and Warning-pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his angry Viſitation have we return'd our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or our obedience and doing good? I
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107154:129"/>look't for that, ſaith God by his Prophets, thats his aym in ſtriking. <hi>I lookt for righteouſneſs, but behold a cry;</hi> a loud and fearful cry compos'd of all our crying ſins together, and the cry continued and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forct to ſuch an height, that we cannot hear his voyce crying to us, nor he in Heaven hear the cry of his peoples prayers, it is ſo drown'd and ſwallowed up in this <hi>Tumultus peccatorum.</hi> What then ſhall we do? Every man ſearch into his own ſoul, and drag thence his moſt beloved ſin, and ſacrifice it as an offering acceptable to God, before that laſt and dreadful viſitation here ſpoken of in the text; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch oppreſſors as are threatned with his coming, in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. And ſuch deadly drunkards as the Age produces now, who were warn'd by our Saviour with a ſpecial Caveat, <hi>Take heed leſt your hearts be over come with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, and ſo that day come upon you unawares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am to touch upon a pair of ſins here cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in this chapter, and to which my Text hath ſpeciall Relation, and this I call the ſecond Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and my return to ſpeak of the coherence which I promiſed. The firſt is Adultery: for of that is mention made before from the 9. to the 13. verſe, implying the hainous and dangerous nature of this ſin, as one of thoſe which we ſhall find moſt unanſwerable at the day of Judgement. Every Heathen Author hath ſome impreſſion; of this. <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his Poem reckons amongſt fires and ſlaughters, great Adulteries as a plague and cauſe of plagues. <hi>Horace</hi> — <hi>hoc fonte derivata cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> &amp;c. What might be added of the defilement, diſgrace, infection and danger to the Agents, their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107154:130"/>poſterity, the whole land? <hi>In populum, patriamque fluxit:</hi> with ſuch a flow as brought the flood on the old world, to rince and loak it clean from this pollution, and brought <hi>Gehennam e Coelo,</hi> Hell out of Heaven upon the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and therefore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>David</hi> to call and cry for all the ſtreams, the whole Ocean, <hi>according to the multitude of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Pſal.</hi> 5. One place of Scripture may ſtand for all the reſt; that 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3. Whereas if God had required nothing elſe, or at leaſt, Sanctification did mainly conſiſt in this: ſo he ſpeaks enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, <hi>This is the Will of God,</hi> even your Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>that you ſhould abſtain from fornication, that every one of you ſhould know to poſſeſs his Veſſell in Sanctification and Honor, not in luſt of concupiſcence, as the Gentiles that know not God.</hi> We find by this, what is the Will of God: and what then ſhall men do? What ſhall they anſwer him? Firſt, Every man cite himſelf <hi>in foro,</hi> in the conſiſtory of his own conſcience, then convicted, (for who is free in all, when our Saviour extends this ſin, even to a luſtfull eye?) to flie and avoid it; and, for our own ſtrength is weakneſs, to pray for aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt to over-ſhadow us, and learn from Examples of holy Men, to anſwer this tentation. <hi>Joſephs</hi> anſwer, <hi>Shall I do this wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Shall I take the members of Chriſt, and make them the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of an Harlot?</hi> God forbid.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſin, to which the words of my Text have immediate reference, is Rigor and Cruelty to Inferiors: Why is this ſuch a matter? May I not uſe my ſervant at my pleaſure? No; It ſeems ſo
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107154:130"/>by <hi>Jobs</hi> Queſtion here; and yet in his time, ſervante were ſlaves; but even a little, but even one degres above beaſts; the Maſters being Owners, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power of life and death; and no doubt but theſe ſlaves (as amongſt the Turks at this day) felt and endured inhumane and cruel uſage in the world. We read of a number of inſolent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and God himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined his own people, and pinned them down with Laws, and ſtill controules the riſing of their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by remembrance of their own condition in <hi>Egypt:</hi> and for that very end, the Holy Ghoſt proceeds here with a double Argument againſt ſuch Inſolency; which <hi>Tremelius</hi> cals <hi>Elegantiſſimam</hi>

I muſt anſwer for this; nay I ſhall not be able to anſwer it, if I be guilty but of this. And the ſecond argument is taken <hi>a jure naturali</hi> in the fifteenth verſe, Is my mold or mettle better then my mans? Is a Lords fleſh and blood of a purer compoſition, then his Grooms, or his Foot-mans? Did not he that made me in the womb, make him? And did not one faſhion us in the womb, or faſhion us in one womb, that is, the common womb of our mother earth? What is then the leſſon hence, but meekneſs for all to practiſe, but ſpecially thoſe in upper place, ſince none is more ſuperior then a Maſter over his ſlave? And
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107154:131"/>for this purpoſe, the Scripture preſents us with two ſtrange examples; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo choſen to advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by God himſelf: So known of God as his friend; Dignified by his miraculous Power in the eyes of his enemies, and by the conduct of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that never man more prompted to take ſtate upon him; and yet it is ſaid, this <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man alive. The other is <hi>David,</hi> when he danced before the Ark, and <hi>Michal</hi> reprooving him, he told her he would be more vile, ſince ſo ſhe called his humility; and confeſſes the bottom of his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. <hi>I have behaved my ſelf, and quieted my ſoul, even as a weaned child.</hi> We find this was (at leaſt they ſaid ſo,) in the intent of thoſe Philoſophers, both Sceptique and Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean, to arrive at <hi>Manſuetudo, &amp; Tranquillus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> to clear the ſoul like a fair and unclouded Heaven; and this was brought us by the Doctor of Heaven, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> both in precept, <hi>Learn of me to be humble and meek, and in patience poſſeſs your ſouls;</hi> and in practice, ſtooping himſelf not to a ſurvey of our miſeries; but clad, encloſed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with all mans infirmities, ſin only accepted; and as unaſhamed, as glorying in his humility, he cries out, tell the daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> not her Servant, but her Soveraign, her King, the King of Kings, comes nnto her meek. — And is it not then a miſerable conſideration, a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpectacle, to ſee a proud man and a humble God; an angry, impatient, and a mercileſs man, and yet <hi>a God of Love and long-ſuffering!</hi> I look to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thence I find deſcending, the Saviour of the world, (<gap reason="foreign">

Yet you know, it is (reſpecting a mans ſelf) unhallowing of Gods Temple, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107154:133"/>the body of Chriſt; reſpecting others, a defiling of the moſt holy and ſolemn Covenant on earth, a kerving aſunder thoſe whom God hath joyned, and therefore ſtands the Commandment forbidding it, betwixt Theſt and Murder. Laſtly, Reſpecting the Land, it is a fire, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks here, at <hi>verſe</hi> 12. devouring foundations, and hurling the flame round about it. And are not they, who have the Power of Coertion, if they do it not, as ſo many Spreaders of this fire, as ſo many Bawds and Pandars if for Bribes, they wilfully palliate or wink at this Diſorder, or look upon it through a falſe and coloured <hi>Medium?</hi> And if ever there was cauſe to cry loud, and lift up the Trumpets voyce to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both you and the whole State, is it not now, when like <hi>Egypt</hi> plagu'd with Frogs, the Land even ſtiaks of this corruption? and had we no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, enough to bring ſome fearfull curſe upon us all.</p>

            <p>But who ſhould help it? how can there any thing be reformed without preſentment? this concerns a ſecond ſort of Viſitors: Church-wardens. And what ſaith your bill my Maſters? Some poor Raſcall will not pay his levy, or the piper hath got a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard: but how many hath your Land-lord gotten? Alas, Sir, we are poor people, and it would be our undoing to meddle with ſuch. But what? your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, they ſay, he is a lewd Toſſe-pot, a very drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Sot. O no! <hi>Omnia bene,</hi> a good Fellow, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle given to company-keeping: thus the beſt of you are content to mince it, or ſome perhaps ready to defend him; and reaſon why: they keep the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and he's the prime gueſt; if it were not for him they might knock down the ſign. Bleſſed be God, I am perſwaded you know not many ſuch as I deſcribe; but yet I fear there be ſome ſtill within the compaſs of theſe marks. And dare not you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them? Nay, dare you preſent any thing? Shall men in office, Viſitours, Wardens, nay watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſworn, thus play with their Oaths? What a wretched thing is it thus to fear men, and deſpiſe God, that great Lord Warden of his Church, who when he ſhall viſit you for this perjury, what will you anſwer him?</p>
            <p>A third ſort of Viſitours are our ſelves, <hi>Sears</hi> called in the old Teſtament, and <hi>Over-ſeers</hi> in the

Let us then learn to diſcharge it, firſt by heeding and viſiting our own hearts, reflecting on and examining our own ſouls, whether the God in our Books, in our Sermons be ſuch in our ſecret breſts, and whether we hear or feel our ſelves rather, when we preach, or whether our preaching run not through us like a wooden Spout, like the old Riddle of Through the wood and never touch it; never touch, never affect the heart. And then ore-look our learning, and ſtrive to mend our nets, giving our ſelves (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith) <hi>recoquendos,</hi> till we become workmen that need not be aſham'd, dividing the Word aright, able to exhort and convince ſoundly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.3. For this it <hi>Ars artium, regimen animarum,</hi> which to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form as commonly tis done, flatteringly, or lazily and perfunctorily, is both eaſie and acceptable, but it is too moſt miſerable and damnable. And then ore-ſee our lives, and thoſe exempt and defend from baſeneſs, but ſpecially that odious ſin, which goes too much in black, drunkenneſs. The way to make the Seer overſeen, to loſe the eyes of his mind, to drown his holy unction in drink, and ſuffocate the Spirit of Grace; he muſt be apt to teach, (ſaith the Apoſtle;) and in the ſame place it follows, <hi>Not addict to Wine,</hi> left that diſqualifie his Palate and Brain, and render him <hi>Ineptum,</hi> unfit to teach, or to be taught. But I haſten to a fourth and laſt ſort of Viſitors, that is, all Chriſtians in performance of that general Duty, which concerns both preacher and People, and is indeed a prime part of Chriſtianity, and that which St. <hi>James</hi> calls <hi>Pure Religion,</hi> namely, <hi>to viſit the fatherleſs and widdows in their adverſity,</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:107154:135"/>and that which will be remembred, and enquired after at the great and dreadfull viſitation by the Judge of all the world, who will demand not what we have preacht, or heard, or profeſſed, bnt what we have done. And among thoſe works of mercy that ſhall follow, and felicitate ſuch as die in the Lord, and ſhall then riſe in the Power of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, this is a Chief, our viſiting the ſick and thoſe in priſon. And the omiſſion of this ſhall be taken as a neglect and refuſing of Chriſt Jeſus in perſon. <hi>In as much as you have not done it to them, you have not done it to me.</hi> Conſider what I have ſaid, and the Lord give you and me, and us all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in all things.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Text antient and catholique; for all times ſeaſonable! fit for all places; fit for all places and perſons. Is it to a King that I preach? I may tell him this Sermon, whereof my Text is a piece, was the firſt piece of ſound Divinity, and preacht to the firſt Monarch-Lord of all the earth; yet preacht by a greater King, even the King of Kings, and Lord
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107154:136"/>of Heaven and Earth. If I were preaching to a Parliament, I could tell them this was the firſt that ever was, in which the firſt malignant-Party was juſtly ſentenc'd, and the two firſt Delinquents in mankind put to Fine and Ranſom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take us together, without reſpect of perſons, and the Text will ſerve to call upon every man here that profeſſes himſelf a ſon and a ſervant, and yet is apt to forget the Law of the Lord his God. Where art thou firſt for the place? In whoſe houſe, in whoſe Courts, in whoſe preſence-Chamber? and even this Demand, conſidering our uſual incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is enough to ſhiver us, as it did <hi>lacob</hi> with Surely God is in this place, and I was not aware. And then where art thou? In whoſe Court of Judicature? and even now to be called to thy anſwer for the ſame buſineſs as <hi>Adam</hi> here; The breach and violation of Gods Commandment. For thou haſt eaten alſo of the forbidden fruit; for ſo is the committing of any thing, againſt which Gods prohibition lies: and are we like then to be found <hi>Recti in Curia?</hi> Can we anſwer him any one thing of a thonſand? ſo the Call will concern us, and the ſenſe of the words will penetrate to our hearts alſo, if we refuſe not, if we run not away from God, and ſeek to hide our tranſgreſsions; in ſumm, it is a Text well worthy our ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may call it an Introduction to a judicial proceeding of God againſt man, after his ſin. For after ſin comes Judgement. <hi>Premit comes.</hi> So it was <hi>ab origine, Adams</hi> caſe! The firſt book-caſe that ever was: And Judgement (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith)
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107154:136"/>begins at the houſe, and more here, it begins with the Son of God: for as in fulneſs of time he ſent his only begotten Son in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and to condemn ſin in the fleſh; and though he knew no ſin, yet to be puniſhed for ſin; being made ſin for us, and bearing all our ſins in his body; So here he comes in the beginning of time, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and condemn ſinfull fleſh in his own Son. Chriſt is his honourable, true and only Son, bego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of his Father before all worlds, by an everlaſting generation and ineffable, that none can declare: But all the ſons of men are his ſons too by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration declared in Ethnique Poety firſt, and then in antient Catholique and Apoſtolick Divinity, made of that Poety, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We are his Off-ſpring and Generation, we all are ſo; but our Forefather was ſo by a kind of Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſly, <hi>Which was the Son of</hi> Adam, <hi>which was the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence, even thus early may we make applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that certainly it will be then a poor and barren, a ſilly and impotent, a baſe and impudent hope for any ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> to look for Impunity. Rather all muſt look in ſeverals, one day to hear this Call of God, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> Whereſoever thou ſhalt be, or howſoever found dead among thoſe that live in pleaſures, drowned and ſoakt in fleſhly luſts, or choacht in wordly cares; or quick from the dead, from that diſperſion and reſolution to watery ſlime and mud, to earthly duſt or aerie Atoms: All the Maſs and Collective body of mankind once made, and then at once remade by his mighty Word, ſhall hear his almighty Word, that Voyce and Trump of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107154:137"/>God, <hi>Return you ſons of men, Ariſe and come to Judgement.</hi> Let us in Gods name and fear do ſo now. Ariſe, quicken our thoughts, prepare for (ſince prevent we cannot) that laſt by conſidering of this firſt Judgement.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wherein the parts are four; our two firſt parts, are the two Parties, appearing in and at this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God the Judge, and man the Delinquent. Our third particular, is the manner of the proceſs Calling; <hi>The Lord God called unto the man:</hi> And the laſt, is the matter of the Summons, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> which in the literal ſenſe is, <hi>Whether art thou fled?</hi> But in the Myſtick, it bears a kind of ſecret Increpation, and a touch of pitty, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> The glory of my Workmanſhip become the ſhame of all the Creatures? Into what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition reduced, that thou art aſhamed of thy ſelf? Alas! <hi>Adam where art thou?</hi> and before we finiſh our Obſervations on the Text, we may come to make uſe of both theſe Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The firſt part of this Judgement, is the two perſons appearing: ſo I ſaid, there were two. But yet it is not ſo; The firſt perſon ſpoken of, is the Judge, and he is preſent; The Lord is at hand. But the guilty ſinner, he flies for't, — <hi>Et non eſt inventus.</hi> But it is not poſſible for him to eſcape, or lie hid; the ſin will find him out; and we muſt all appear. <hi>Rejoyce O young man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi>) <hi>Eccle.</hi> 11. <hi>in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107154:137"/>difference; every ſoul to anſwer for every thing done in every body. The Judge is of pure and fiery eyes, ſees down through darkneſs to our hearts and reins; no caſting of miſts, no deluding of this Judge; and then no need of long proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, frequent ſiftings, and tedions Cribrations of the cauſe; for all things are naked and bare in his ſight, all evident and clear before this Lord; for this Lord is God, <hi>The Lord God is his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Now the names of God are referred to two heads. 1. Simple and abſolute; or 2. In Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us. Of the firſt ſort, Some reſpect his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Nature, as that name which we know not certainly how, but we are taught to pronounce <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Some reſpect that which we call (but yet in tender ſenſe dare ſcarce call it ſo,) his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, as the names of Father, Son and Spirit: And ſome, his Attributes Eſſential, as Juſt, Holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond kind of relative names, are ſuch as King, Governor, Preſerver, and this of <hi>Dominus</hi> here, <hi>the Lord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Firſt for the Name, and ſo the Nature of God; it is an Ocean too immenſe and boundleſs for our diſcovery; An Abyſs for the ſounding of our light and frail reaſon to propound. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Title <hi>Lord,</hi> I will not enter (though my Text lie near the Creation,) into that curious diſpute which yet amuſed <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, whether this ſtile then only and properly began in the worlds beginning, and could not be attributed to God before. Such ſpeculation is but drie and uſeleſs ſtuff; I will rather tell you what the School tells us of all Gods Names in relation, that is,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107154:138"/>ſuch Names are not really in God, but in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So as God is called <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> not becauſe God cannot admit a compoſition of thoſe two, or any pieces, but becauſe his <hi>Bonitas,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of all other, and diffuſive to all, ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminently above all; And becauſe all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the name of Good, as derivative from him; ſo in it ſelf defective, and to us deficient in compare with him, (ſaith <hi>Aquinas,</hi>) and yet even in affecting and accepting ſuch names, God delivers himſelf to us in a gracious way of endearment. For where men aſpire to Honor, and aſcend to titular additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore that the ſwelling vapor of a <hi>Longa Pagina</hi> (as he calls it,) may lift them like a Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant high in the air, and hal'd from the community of baſer earth, God in a wonderfull deſcending ſtill vouchſafes rather to honor his ſervants and Clients by ſometimes aſſuming names of particular and individual reference, as the God of <hi>Abrabam,</hi> the fear of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſometimes of general appliance to all the Iſrael of God, as is the large extended and branching Tree, the ſpreading Sun in an Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Dilatation, Emanation, Communication, Conſolation to all his ſervants in this full and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full name of <hi>Dominus,</hi> the Lord.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Which name in the ſtrict and proper accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (they ſay,) can belong of right to none but God, by reaſon it includes theſe two conditions. Firſt. He that is exactly <hi>Dominus,</hi> may at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure uſe the thing whereof he is Lord; enlarge, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, change, annihilate, that is, as far as the nature of the thing will bear; And who is ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream on earth?

But thus far only this Note will eaſily fall upon, and into our conſciences, if we reſiſt not, if we deſpight not the Spirit of this Grace.

The vileneſs of ſin is many wayes diſcovered in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Holy Ghoſt: It is to a main height of expreſſion, when God deſcends to ſo low a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107154:140"/>compariſon, as that in <hi>Amos, I am preſt under your ſins, as a Care is preſt under many ſheafs.</hi> My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, my ſtubbornneſs is a dangerous ſin done againſt my Prince, or Paſtor, or Parents. And my violences, my cruelties are heavy ſins, becauſe in them I oppreſs my brother, as a good man, it may be better in his eye that made us both, then my ſelf. But did I ever underſtand till now, that I may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs him that is <hi>optimus maximus,</hi> my God alſo? <hi>Is it not enough to weary men</hi> (ſayes the Prophet) but ſhall I dare to vex and weary my God alſo? and afflict and grieve my gracious Lord and his Holy Spirit. No wonder we find <hi>David</hi> complaining, <hi>My ſins are a ſore burden too heavy for me to bear,</hi> when <hi>Davids</hi> Lord tunes his voice to the ſame key, <hi>Your ſins are a ſore burden, too heavy for me to hear.</hi> Doſt thou not ſee O vain man by this, the vileneſs, the odiouſneſs of thy ſin, which makes him impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that is Omnipotent? As alſo in that term of <hi>Abomination;</hi> How frequent is the uſe thereof in holy Scripture, to cauſe us to write this leſſon into all our ſouls from thence? Nothing makes us ſo ugly ſpectacles to that Lord our God as ſin, which cauſes him to turn his face away in diſpleaſure, not able to abide us in his ſight, nay forced to deny his own workmanſhip, <hi>Depart, I know you not;</hi> thus mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ignorant that is Omniſcient. And yet above, and beyond, and beneath all theſe we may collect the height, and breadth, and depth of a ſinners dangerous and fearfull condition by thoſe ſpeeches of anger and provocation. The wrath of a King is as Meſſengers of death, the Wiſe man tells us, <hi>and he that provokes him to anger, ſins
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107154:141"/>againſt his own ſoul.</hi> What is it when we provoke the holy one of Iſrael to anger? <hi>O Lord, rebuke me not in thy anger:</hi> if in that mood I be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Judgement, O Lord, who is able to abide it? And this is doubtleſs one of the depths of Satan, one of his main aims in provoking us to ſin, that thereby God being provoked to anger, may declare himſelf our enemy: What ſhall we then ſay, Men and Brethren? What will we then do? May we not then ſay juſtly, that other Lords have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly reigned over us? <hi>Infoelix Lolium, &amp; ſteriles dominantur,</hi> — our baſe and barren luſts and pleaſures have indeed juſtly by Gods permiſſion, and by way of puniſhment had dominion over us, by our willing ſubmiſſion of our ſouls to their ſway and tyranny: And will we ſtill do ſo, continue in ſin, ſtill make a mock of groſs and grievous ſins, never ſtartle, or admit the leaſt umbrage of remorſe at open blaſphemies, and often Adulteries, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſes? Are not ſuch mens Souls and Bodies, States and Children in a fearfull manner engaged to the wrath of God, which they hourly provoke by theſe abominations? Alas! poor wretched man or woman, however titled. Preacher or Hearer, Lawyer or Courtier, Lord or Lady, every wickedneſs, every known ſin I dwell and delight in, and reſolve on, is not only a touching pitch, whence inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defilement, nor a carrying fire in my boſom, impoſſible to eſcape detriment, but is an oppoſition, a rebellious outſtanding and ſleighting of my God; enmity: for the wrath of God is manifoldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from Heaven, and Wiſdom cries it in the ſtreets; Gods Declaration we are not ignorant of;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107154:141"/>and dare we then deſpiſe? If I be a Lord, where's my fear? What earthly Monarch, the anointed of the Lord (unleſs ſuper-anointed with the ſpirit of patience and meekneſs above mortals,) can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his lawfull Commands to be vilified? And can we look for leſs then ſuddain execution of that wrath which is drawn out, and ready to fall on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and hath been the ſinners caſe from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? <hi>Adam</hi> was our firſt Father that found it ſo, and we his ſinfull iſſue, on whom the ends of the world are come, do, and ever ſhall find it ſo till the conſummation; for the perpetuating of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in God is made manifeſt by that of the Apoſtle, where he ſhews us plainly, and as if he ſaw the arrow falling, or the lightning blaze of Gods revengeſull fire ſeizſing on, and cingeing the ſinners hairie ſcalp that goes on ſtill in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; For ſuch things ſake, (ſaith he,) look about you, — <hi>Behold the wrath of God cometh upon the Children of diſobedience.</hi>

And ſure this very firſt conſideration of Gods infinite Power will ſhudder every meer humane, make every undeviliſht bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom tremble. It was a King that ſaid it, and a man after Gods own heart, and no doubt felt it in his own heart, <hi>Stand in aw, and ſin not;</hi> In aw? Of whom ſhall Lords and Kings ſtand in aw? of him that is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; The Lord God; I ſay unto you, <hi>Fear him;</hi> Fear him that is able to deſtroy Dominion and Regality, able to reverſe all victories, confound all earthly glory with diſgrace, and compound all worldly honor with the duſt, that is the Lord God here in my Text. Set not light by him that is able to hurt or help, was <hi>Ethick</hi> advice of the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Preacher, <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> but it was a divine ſentence in the lips of the King before, the royal Preacher to Gods own darling people <hi>Iſrael, Contend not with one ſtronger then thou.</hi> And the famous Preacher of the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> opens all ſinners eyes and ears to apprehend this enſuing danger in that applicatory queſtion, <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to jealonſie, to anger?

Tuſh, this is needleſs now, ſaith my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant; Who knows not this? <hi>ſtronger then God?</hi> Who ever opened his mouth to ſay ſo? But yet there is an inteſtine, there is a viſceral Blaſphemy, as well as oral, and as ill every whit. The fool that ſaith in his heart, <hi>There is no God,</hi> or elſe a blind, a drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107154:142"/>or an impotent God, either he cannot, or he will not regard; all ſuch ſecret thoughts are as open Blaſphemies, though not ſo infectious. And therefore I beſeech thee, whoever thou art, for Gods ſake, if not for thy own ſouls ſake, to take notice, and to beware; For doſt not thou conceive that every hard hearted, every unrelenting ſoul feels ſome ſuch ſuſurration in the ſecret &amp; ſilence of her own Cloſet and Cloiſter, ſome ſuch carnal inſpiration, while ſhe reſolves not to repent, but to continue in known ſins? and ſaith in effect, I have heard much of Gods Power, and the Preacher would make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live that the Word of God is a Wiſdom divine, and Gods heavenly Power to my ſalvation; But ſure I find that Word (let them read it, preach, urge it never ſo forcibly,) is yet too weak, and all their ghoſtly Councils and Exhortations of no value: I am ſure, I never yet found them prevalent with me, but that I am able, during the very Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-time to ſleep; and find that I am not only proof againſt all their perſwaſions, but perſwaded that neither this man, though well voyc'd, nor that, though cryed up for a powerfull Speaker, nor the whole Tribe indeed, ſhall ever be able to prevail over me. 'Tis true indeed that God only can break in upon mans ſoul, and the Word we preach, which is but improperly called his Word, and is ſo no ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we are carefull to ſeparate the precious Truth of Heaven from earthly inventions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions. Yet take heed of deſpiſing the meaneſt Inſtrument that God ſends upon this Embaſſie, and reſolve that all Reſolvings againſt the charming Power of Gods, are from the ſuggeſtion of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107154:143"/>foul ſpirit. And if any of this audience ſhould be infected, I ſay, if this ſhould be ſo, though (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in Chriſt Jeſus,) this ought not ſo to be; and though I fully hope for better things of you; yet for fear it may be ſo, by reaſon of our common frailty; and if this qualification of Omnipotency in God ſhake us nothing, yet let this that follows; trie to diſimprove and prevent, or infeeble all the Charms of the Serpent, and diſmantle all the ſtrong holds and ſorts of Satan in our hearts which would put us on Gods Comminatory <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieris;</hi> That there is a ſecond property in God (I might na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="15">15. OUR ſecond part, is, the ſecond Party appearing in this Judgement, <hi>Man,</hi> the Delinquent. I told you God was an Ocean ſouldleſs, fathomleſs; and when I find St. <hi>John</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me that Chriſt who is God, need not that any man ſhould tell him what is in man, for he knew; it leaves a little of the knowledge of man behind it namely this, That man is a thing not, or not well known to any but God; not to another, not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And when I hear his ſervants <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> put that Query, <hi>What is man?</hi> they both put it to God himſelf to anſwer; and in thoſe very anſwers which they make by Gods own inſpirations, we find and know ſtill that man cannot be found and known, and that there are corners and Incognita's in this Microcoſm, that are not laid out fully in any Chart, but left only to the diſcovery of him that is <hi>the ſearcher of hearts.</hi> But yet for our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſuddain apprehenſion of man, I will turn you but to two books, if I do that; (for there is much reaſon, I'le be brief, if for nothing elſe, yet a little to quit and recompence my former being too long;) And the firſt book ſhall be this of the Creation, this very book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and but one place in the book, <hi>Chapter</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>The Lord God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into him, into his Noſtrils the breath of life, and man became a living foul.

But I will enlarge my ſelf in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Note for all this Audience, whatſoere we are, what uſe ſoever ye mean to make of the Preacher and the Sermon, being both plain &amp; home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtuff, and will ſerve perchance at dinner to fill out diſcourſe, and help to hold compariſons: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God deprehend us now, or apply himſelf to us here, or we to him, and his Vicegerent, in our affections or intentions good or bad: Once, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we differ, yet one primordial and finall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is paſt upon us all; one Law gone out and over all mankind, that arreſts, and enwraps, takes in all (Prince and people) and layes up all together; Duſt thou art (be ſure) and (as ſure) to duſt thou ſhalt return: Every ſon of man like the firſt from the earth earthy.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107154:145"/>look to thoſe things of my ſelf, but I am able by Gods gracious aſſiſtance to look to this reformation of my ſelf. And certainly as families make towns; and they make Common-wealths and Churches: ſo private and particular perſons are the roots and ſprings of all, and their ſeveral Reformations are the roots and ſprings of all Reformation too. But yet as in Reforming States. I doubt not but States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the moſt ſtately of them had need to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in prayer to God; or elſe without his bleſſing all may prove but a ſhock and conflict of wits: nay worſe (for <hi>Bella, horrida Bella</hi> may enſue) except he bleſs, unleſs the Lord God keep us, Builders and Watchmen ſhall do all in vain: So is it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the reforming of our ſouls; <hi>for we are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus to good works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. And this diſcerning the work of God in his own breſt, is that other book to which I would refer man for diſcovery of himſelf. The book of conſcience it is which lies open, and layes man open to himſelf; if he read there and find <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitum Dei,</hi> the Hand-writing of God both of Law and Goſpel in his heart, ingrav'd in that Table, then it is another, a ſecond book of <hi>Geneſis:</hi>

               <hi>Adans</hi> to prevent a Second by a timely conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this firſt Judgement, I made four parts; the two firſt, are the two parties appearing in this Judicature; God the Judge, and Man the Delinquent: The other two, are the manner of the Proceſs by way of calling, and the matter of the Summons, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> Of which the ſenſe is double, by way of Queſtion firſt, and then in a way of Commiſeration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the firſt particular, and the Judges names of <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> I ſpake fully the laſt time, and of the dangerous nature of ſin which provokes ſo great, and then ſo gracious a Lord God to indignation, to hate, and then to puniſhment. Finding this boundleſs Ocean of God, his Names and Nature too profound, we came to a diſcovery of Man, our ſecond Particular; and obſerving how hard it is for man to ſearch into himſelf, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of every mans learning in this difficult point I pointed you to two books: the firſt, this book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and therein Principally the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſe 7. wherein is laid down by God ſuch a deſcription of man as will let us eaſily diſcern our wretched and earthly materials; which to reform, I told you of the other book, the book of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wherein as in a Glaſs, a man man view him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſee of what faſhion he is; that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet abiding in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> or be paſt over into an <hi>Exodus,</hi> and eſcaped in ſome good meaſure the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which be in nature and in the world through Luſts.

            <p n="3">3. Two ſorts of men then there are both igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and arrogant that reject this book of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> nor endure thereby to be put to their Purgation, to their Clergy where the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicle is both Greck and Latine, Heathen and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian too, <gap reason="foreign">

The firſt of theſe is the Painted Phariſee, who thinks himſelf, and thinks he is ſcarce to thank God, and thanks himſelf that he is not like other men: but one <hi>per ſe</hi> that can predeſtinate, elect, call, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, ſanctifie and glorifie himſelf; for he can view and review, and diſcover and relate at pleaſure thoſe Records above, and find or ſet down there his own certain, and it may be the name of a ſpecial friend of his too (if he think fit,) in that book of life above, without ſearching thoſe rouls above, or examining the book of his own life. For as we have Muſhrum Preachers, Lecturing before read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a birth before conception, miraculous Fellows: (And I would that were the worſt, would it were but froth and vanity, and a tedious nothing, and that they did not conceive miſchief, and bring forth ſedition;) So their Diſciples, or rather their Patrons and Matrons too, can make ſure work of their ſalvation without working it out with fear and trembling, and are pefect in Heavens way by a directory of their own private ſpirit, without book. The ſecond is the meer worldling,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107154:147"/>
               <hi>Filius terrae,</hi> earth-born and bred, that comes up like a vernal flower in green and yellow; a kind of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and like him becomes his own glaſs and book; There he ſtudies, and pores, and doats day and night, and eſteems himſelf a rare piece, becauſe fairly bound up in Velome with ſilk ſtrings, painted, and guilded, and emboſt with his Arms, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs engraven, and printed <hi>cum priviligio</hi> in a large <hi>Folio, — Stultitiam patiuntur opes;</hi> But <hi>Quid intus?</hi> He that runs may read him through; In the very Frontiſpice and Title-page in capital Letters, ſtand <hi>Caro,</hi> and <hi>Carion,</hi> and <hi>Carcaſe,</hi> — and — nothing elſe, but a few ſcatterred Principles and Concluſions of fleſh and blood: Or, if <hi>Homo</hi> be there, 'tis ſunk beneath his <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and drowned in Animals — <hi>in malis;</hi> not beſet with, or ſet on by, but ſet in evil, — <hi>in maligno poſitus;</hi> and it is a Permalignancy, like a compleat Armor, <hi>from the Crown of the head,</hi> ſaith <hi>I ſaiah, to the ſole of his foot.</hi> It is not quartering, nor a Party <hi>per pale,</hi> but his whole Scutcheon is <hi>una litera,</hi> Coat and Creſt, and Supporters and all. <hi>He walks with a ſtiff neck,</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens himſelf in his wickedneſs, and makes his boaſt that he can and will do miſchief;</hi> and yet this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thing will brag of Deſcent, and coming in with Conquerors and Kings. Alas! Where art thou O vain man? Here I am ſure both he and we were once in <hi>Maſſa corrupta;</hi> Our prime Anceſtor (you ſee,) a Rebel, and the next of our kin, — <hi>Illud quod dicere nolo;</hi> we can get no Credit by naming him. And then in this miſerable condition, if he be a King on earth, never ſo highly born,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:107154:148"/>
               <hi>unleſs he be born again, he can never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> unleſs waſht and made Kings and Prieſts in his blood, and reſtored in that ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> The meer natural man may derive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>Belus;</hi> but Gods calls every ſuch man a ſon of <hi>Belial;</hi> and his condition is <hi>Bellual,</hi> nay worſe then that of the brute beaſt, though he be a man ſtill; And though this may anger and offend him to be told thus barely of it; yet ſuch a man (but I ſhall hope there is no ſuch man here) muſt know that if he remain in that mind ſtill unappall'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and therefore careleſs to prevent the wrath to come, that he hath deveſted man, or loſt at leaſt all excellency above beaſt, though he be yet a ſeeming man, and a ſeemly, and an handſome man, a proper valiant brave gentleman, or a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dainty man, never ſo great, ſo noble a man, and take in all that can be in a man. For wretched man his Anceſtor is here cited in that nature, and deprehended in that notion of a man. <hi>Adam</hi> (you ſee here,) though fouly bruiſed inwardy, is ſtill a man after his ſin, though now made of good evil, and miſerable of happy. Sin deſtroyes not humane nature in the act or habit, but in the harmony. The Order, and Beauty, and Excellency of our nature (like a Clock thats broken,) is loſt, defac'd and ruin'd. What a ſillineſs is it then to argue ſin as meerly nothing, and make a mock of all reproof, becauſe it introduces no decay, no ſenſible alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the body? And yet ſome acts of ſome kind of wickedneſs are forcible even to thy corporal deſtruction, and thou mayeſt come to mourn at the end when thou haſt conſumed thy fleſh and thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:107154:148"/>that very body of thine which thou loveſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any body, better then thy own immortal ſoul. There is ſuch a Text as applies it ſelf to thee (perhaps,) in a literal ſenſe; and if not to thee, there be too many able to comment upon't, and he is bleſt that is not conſcious now, or whoſe body will not call upon him ere long, and repeat this part of the Sermon in his own woſull experience. But be it granted, (as it muſt,) that ſin is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible averſion from God, rather then a ſenſible apprehenſion of loſs, or pain, or change in nature; yet we know it is held a dangerous Symptom in a ſick mans ſtate if he be ſenſeleſs, and when he lies for dead perceives not his infirmity: ſo it is to be heart-ſick of ſin, a captive taken, and no feeling of his ſickneſs, nor deſcerning of his own thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. What is then to be done? but to take up our book of conſcience, and read, and find there our diſtemper, eſpecially by applying it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the book of Gods declared Will, find our <hi>Errata,</hi> and labor to an amendment of life; for to ſuch is that ſharp but ſweet voice of the Spirit directed, <hi>O conſider you that forget God and your ſelves;</hi> and again, <hi>Ariſe thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand up from the dead.</hi> And ſince ſin and our humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are from the beginning, ſo, not only concorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And learn and labor to give all diligence to enrobe our ſelves in the rayment of our elder brother, the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> whoſe odor may make us acceptable to our heavenly Father; This is that <hi>Pia moroſitas,</hi> that <hi>Sacra fames,</hi> in the proper ſenſe that holy hunger, and honing and whyning; that pure perverſneſs of the ſoul, when like earthly minds in point of food, or garments, or building they can never leave, but take up dayly new deſires. We are diſpleaſed from time to time with our preſent weak condition, and deſirous to encreaſe in Grace, and grow up from one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of perfection to another, <hi>cleanſing our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord.</hi>

The firſt ſound was nor ſo diſtinct (ſaies he) nor ſo loud; but like as the Trumpet of the Law began low at firſt; but now he preſſes the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders conſcience; where firſt for Gods cauſe, that is for Gods Glory, let me crave again this advertency in your diſcerning, what it is that calls us from ſin. The ſame Spirit that began in the Creation, Reviſits his own work, and excels himſelf in thy Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It was God which call'd <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R,</hi> which ſignifies a fire or light: and then brought him to a ſweeter, clearer fire, and better and purer Light, even that Light which was both revealed to the Gentiles after, and remain'd the glory of his people <hi>Iſrael;</hi> All the Iſrael of God (united) both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Grecians, bond or free;</hi> on whom <hi>nor circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion</hi> was regardable. For thoſe are nothing (ſaies the Apoſtle) what then is ſomething? Nay, what is it then that is all things? This only, To become a new creature; <hi>wherewith ſhall a yong man,</hi> that is the ſot, the Prodigal in the Parable, that hath waſted all his ſtock, and is mad, out of his right mind; how ſhall this man that is
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:107154:150"/>troubled with the Scotomy and Vertigo, a youthful wildneſs and unſtayedneſs in his brains, how ſhall he recover, come to himſelf again, and from his blinded and diſtempered flight, find the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to hir heavenly Father? This is hard, but may be effected by taking heed according to thy Word. There is a power in Nature, but the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ſhining in his Word by the joynt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Spirit (for theſe two ever work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) is a power indeed, mighty in operation, to caſt down the ſtrong holds of Satan. Not as it is the Miniſtry of men (though the Diſpenſation be ours) no not all thoſe Clarious of his holy Prophets that ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt; to which we do well to attend (ſaies St. <hi>Peter</hi>) as a more ſafe Word, and as to a Light ſhining in a dark place, till the day dawn, till God ſend the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous light of his Goſpel. And then it is not in the Inſtruments; Not in <hi>John</hi> greater then a Prophet, and a ſtout and plain deliverer of the Truth; and not a Reed ſhaken with the wind, and bending his Doctrines to humour his variouſly inclin'd Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Nor in <hi>Paul</hi> thas was <hi>Os orbi ſufficiens</hi> (as that Golden-mouth'd father calls that bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.) And all his Succeſſors in any part of the world muſt know, that their Voyces are but ſtill and ſoft Muſick, and a ſound <hi>qui aures percutit</hi> — reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to the ear. But the inward Miniſter (of whom we heard before) inſtructs the heart. Tis Gods Ephata that can do that. That alone can call from the ſleep and death of ſin, and from the grave of corruption. <hi>Qui dixit ſine me non poteſtis cogitare bene, multo magis dixit ſine me non poteſtis credere.</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:107154:151"/>To believe is a greater work, and of greater Grace and Power then to conceive a good thought. Yet both thoſe rich ſtreams run from one and the ſame Fountain.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But this Impotency will not be believ'd to preſs and lie on all mankind. How gladly would ſome men find out ſome way in themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be leſs beholden to the Grace of God I Ungracious to God for his Grace: and would gladly forget, or fain to forget that God ſo inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly remembers men with his preventing, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, with his inchoative, and concomitant, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, and perſevering Graces; Graces of all ſorts and all ſeaſons. Bold and preſumptuous men that purpoſely neglect to magnifie the operations of Gods Graces on them, becauſe they would derive the <hi>Magnificat</hi> and <hi>Benidictus</hi> on themſelves, and ſo ſacrifice to their own nets, not looking up to the prime and conſtant mover of all, not regarding the ſtrong God of their Salvation. There is indeed a Rate and a Sect of men, who will perchance be content that God ſhall be kind and gracious to ſome feeble ones, that ſtand in need of his aſſiſtance. Sick and weak people may need the Phyſick of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctor. But not ſuch able men, ſuch Saints and perfectiſts as they; men that are wholly taken up with the admiration of themſelves, and their own purity. Who yet muſt know that if they have been kept from falling into groſs ſins, and are therefore apt to deride mine or any other mans weakneſſes who have been and do confeſs as much, frequently overtaken and overcome, yet it is ſtill the ſame graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand that hath done the ſeveral cures on both.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:107154:151"/>That God whoſe Grace was all the while a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative to them, was to me and him that ſlipt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative.

For ſimply in the ſtate of nature, both he and I were even; that is, even able to do nothing as of our ſelves; So far from being ſure of Gods Election, that we were not yet under this Grace of Vocation; nor Law, nor Goſpel-calling, and ſo without Chriſt, &amp; ſo without God in the world.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is now the third Entrance on this Entrance of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon man after his Lapſe, which is the firſt of all the three pieces of Divinity. And this Third, this our new conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Judgement, and Gods Method in proceeding, may open by his aſſiſtance another door of utterance; and ſo we may make another and another Method of proceeding with this, or any other Text of Scripture. For as there
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:107154:155"/>is little reaſon for that Painter who uſes to inſcribe his pieces, to bind all other Work-men to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: So though it is impoſſible for any man dividing the Truth aright, and ſpeaking out of the pure Word of God things conſentaneous thereunto for inſtruction of Gods people, to avoid Doctrine, or for any but grraceleſs Hearers not to ſuffer the Word of Exhortation, of Reproof, of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to have a gracious uſe in their hearts and hands; (for Religion ſhould be hearted firſt, and handed after,) in their Underſtanding firſt, and then in their Life and Converſation: Yet I never found in the Sermons of the Lord Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor in thoſe of his Apoſtles, nor in their Succeſſors, the Primitive Fathers of the firſt well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, nor in thoſe of the now deformed Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in thoſe of the firſt Reformed Churches, that they confin'd themſelves, much leſs bound over all others, on pain of ſin or abſurdity, to one, and ſuch only form and way of Teaching, which beſide the violence offered to mens ſpirits, is (to my Underſtanding,) a kind of Reſtraint put upon the free Spirit of that God, <hi>which works all in all,</hi> yet deals by a diverſity of gifts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes in variety of thoſe gifts to every mans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Capacity. So that in this for the Divine, that rule of the Moraliſt will hold, <hi>Nullius addictus, &amp;c.</hi> tied to none, nor ever to a mans own Methode; witneſs this attempt of mine in this farther proceſs upon this very Text, as it includes a Judgement, and the Method of that Judgement. Theſe are now our two, and all our parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, When the ſtory hath told us of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:107154:156"/>Man and Womans Diſobedience, it ſhews us after their ſin, their ſhame; for that's the firſt born iſſue of ſin. Now they ſaw and knew themſelves every way, outwardly and inwardly, in bodies and ſouls, naked, deſpoil'd and deſtitute. They run from God, and would hide themſelves then both from him and themſelves. Arguments ever of guilty minds fore caſting cruel things; and then enters the Text with Judgement; but what is here begun, ſpreads as far as <hi>v.</hi> 20. before the ſentence be ended.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whence the point of Doctrine on eaſie Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may be, that our Judgement ſhall certainly overtake and come upon us. Hath the Senate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned me to die? (ſaith he,) Why ſo? Hath Nature condemned them to die too? So hath God called me to ſit and judge other men; perchance thoſe other men might better ſit upon me, and peradventure they ſhall yet ere I die: If that be unexampled, it is not impoſſible; but it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eſcape the Judgement of God; There is a Previſion of that, and of the Conflagration, and of the Conſternation which ſhall be then: all as old as the viſions of <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>When the Thrones were caſt down, and the Antient of days did ſit, — A fiery ſtream iſſued, and came forth before him; Thouſands of thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him; the Judgement was ſet, and the Books were opened.</hi> And another viſion of that, as new and as late as the laſt piece of all Gods Revealed Will to men, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11, 12, 13. <hi>verſes. I ſaw a white Throne,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi>) <hi>and him that ſat thereon, from whoſe face the earth and the heaven fied away,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:107154:156"/>and there was found no place for them; and I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great ſtand before God, and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the books, according to their works: and the ſea gave up his dead, and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them; and they were judged every man according to their works.</hi> And theſe proofs, theſe large allegations from the old and new Teſtament we may uſe inſtead of larger reaſons; for if thoſe reaſons (men ſpeak ſo much of,) riſe clearly from the fountain Truth of Gods eternal Word, they are worthy of ſome higher, and nobler names then Reaſons; but if not taken from clear Scripture Grounds, or if they flow from other principles, then to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divine Truth, what reaſons are they? Two things only then I would gladly print on every ſoul, (and from this double viſion which opens and cloſes up this Inſtruction,) 1. Put you firſt in mind of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Caveat, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. where the Doctrine is not to judge, <hi>Not to ſet at nought our Brother;</hi> and this is made the reaſon, <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, and every one of us give account of himſelf to God.</hi> 2. The other is St. <hi>Judes</hi> Induction, remembring us of Gods conſtant courſe preceding in deſtruction of the unbelievers among his own people; in reſerving the lapſed Angels to everlaſting chains under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Judgement of the great day; in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> ſuffering the vengeance of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal ſire; and concludes with the Prophecy as old as <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:107154:157"/>(our exampe here,) which ſo early gave the world warning and witneſs of this Lords coming to execute Judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly of all their ungodly deeds, and of all their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their rough and hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him: So that as <hi>David</hi> in the 19. <hi>Pſalm</hi> confounds the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> denying the Glory of God by a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heavens, and confirmed by the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under Gods own hand, and utters it by the ſpeech and voice of day and night; all which ſpeak all languages, and as the bleſſed Apoſtle applies that to the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>The ſound whereof went into all the earth, and to the ends of the world;</hi> and then asks the queſtion, Did not Iſrael know? ſo I may apply all thoſe paſſages in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning Gods coming in flaming fire to rende <hi>Vengeance,</hi> to all that are, or mean to be of the Iſrael of God, Have we not known that which was fore-known ſo many ages ſince in the famous confeſſion of the Heathen, — <hi>Affore Tempus, quo mare, quo tellus — ardeat?</hi> ſo abundantly teſtimonied by the Prophets, by our Saviour and the Apoſtles, That as the flood of water was to rince the <hi>old world,</hi> ſo all the corruptions of the New, ſhall again be purged in ſtreams of purifying <hi>fire,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Pet. ult.</hi> and that none of all the corrupt maſs of mankind ſhall avoid that tryal. Is there not fair warning, a fair Intimation here for all the branches by Gods ſtriking at the root, and by his Inquiſition made againſt the firſt Offender that ever was? <hi>The Lord God called unto the man, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:107154:157"/>3. And here we might infer that uſefull part of Sermons in uſes, of which the chief are ſtill but two; reducible they are all to two heads, <hi>Timor &amp; Amor;</hi> 1. Fear, <hi>Come then and I will teach you the fear of the Lord:</hi> Come, and by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord, learn, and by this calling on the firſt, Let us all at laſt learn to call one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but moſt of all upon our own ſouls, to ſtand in aw of <hi>this Judge of all the world:</hi> as for man, we underſtand his Power is lined and chalkt out, and we know what is his <hi>ultima linea.</hi> But there is a line yet more ultimate, that reaches down to the infernal pit, and to the ſecond death. <hi>Fear him that is able to caſt both body and ſoul into fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable;</hi> Before whoſe Judgement-ſeat no Proxie is admitted; from whoſe juſt Doom, no Bribe, no Lords Letter, no Kings interceſſion can deliver us. 2. And then <hi>Amor</hi> too not to be forgotten for all this; For, for all this executing of Judgement, for all this erecting a Judgement-ſeat in Paradiſe againſt the firſt ſinners there; yet even there and then was laid the foundation of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat in Chriſt. The womans ſeed was promiſed then, which was ſent in ſulneſs of time to deliver us from that wrath to come. And therefore can there be a greater Impulſive or Incentive to man to love the Lord? No, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this, and loves not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maraxatha, accurſed till that coming of the Lord in a ſecond Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus far our firſt part, <hi>The Judgement,</hi> with the Doctrine, and the uſes upon that, to ſhew, that as I will not be bound to follow, ſo will I never
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:107154:158"/>abhor even that eaſie Methode of making Sermons. Our ſecond and laſt part of the Text in this laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of it, which is <hi>the Methode of this Judgement,</hi> which we ſhall look upon by your patience in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect; one to the delinquent <hi>Adam,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God the Judge.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Firſt for the man, He is here brought firſt into queſtion, God calls firſt to him, and not to the Serpent, or to the woman. And in ſuch occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obſervations as this, that clearing and light which the ſoul receives in apt ſolutions, when ſhe doubts, or is in darkneſs, may moſt properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the rendring of a reaſon.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, it is impoſſible ſometimes to reaſon upon ſome points of manifeſt Doctrine, unleſs we mean to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure them under a pretence of giving light, as to tell why God is juſt, or why mercifull. The Mercy of God in the firſt act, is his inclination; in the ſecond, it is the exhibition of Mercy to us. No reaſon of the firſt at all, and of the ſecond no reaſon at all but the firſt. But where the thing we teach, may fall under queſtion, there it is a ſweet and delightfull thing to mans underſtanding to receive ſatisfaction; ſuch at leaſt, as if it do not fill up all Scruple in us, may yet in the things of God poſſeſs our ſouls with a moderate &amp; reverend acquieſcence. As in this caſe of <hi>Adams,</hi> the reaſon is afforded, why he comes firſt to the bar. Firſt the Serpent was now incorrigible, and had no ſhare in this gracious Call, which was <hi>ad Correctionem, non ad ruiram.</hi> And then in compare with the woman, he was the greater ſinner, firſt as a man, and then as her Husband, In uſe, it is nor ſex, nor perſon, but ſin, the

And even here, the laſt in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending may be as bad as the firſt, or worſe. <hi>Jacobs</hi> other ſons inexcuſable, becauſe they came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and on more advantage to the ſlaughter of the <hi>Sechemites.</hi> Greatneſs then or Superiority is no bar to this Inqueſt; <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is branded for making Iſrael to ſin; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> for pertaking wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſin of <hi>Eve.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> ſin with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> the Prophet of God is ſent to him with a ſpecial Writ; and it not miſtaken; it was no falſe arreſt; Thou art the man. Nay, our perſons and high places are motives to Judgements, which like rains, ſall moſt on hills and eminent places.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly, Reſpecting the other party who is offended; God is Judge himſelf; ſo is he ever in all acts of true Judgement, though done by Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates; but here is an act immediate, <hi>The Lord God in his own perſon.</hi> It is not ever ſo; for obſerve, that as God here in the firſt foundation of mankind judges the firſt Monarch; ſo in that firſt foundation of his people under Kings, he judges <hi>Saul</hi> for inobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence like another <hi>Alam;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> too for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like another <hi>Cain.</hi> The remarkable difference of the proceſs is: Here he doth it by himſelf; To <hi>Adam</hi> he comes calling, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi es?</hi> and to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4 9. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi eſt Abel?</hi> But to the two Kings he ſends two of his Miniſters, two of his Prophets, <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Nathan.</hi> Why this different addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Judgement? Was it the foulneſs of the offence? <hi>Sauls</hi> firſt ſeems a groſſer diſobedience then <hi>Adams:</hi> Regardleſs of Gods expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, he reſerves <hi>Agag,</hi> and the fatteſt and beſt
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:107154:159"/>of the ſpoils; as <hi>Adam</hi> took the fruit forbidden, and then <hi>iterates</hi> his offence in offering Sacrifice, intruding on the ſacred function, which never King could violate without exemplary puniſhment: As <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> ſtand for proofs in <hi>Chronicles;</hi> and then <hi>Davids</hi> ſin ſeems ſouler then <hi>Cains;</hi> Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terating <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> wife, making him drunk, and then contriving ſo to murder him, though it drew on the ſlaughter of many of his own Souldiers, and Gods ſervants, and occaſioned the enemy, the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed enemy to triumph in their bloods. A ſin doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs moſt horrible; and as the School-men thwack and throng into <hi>Adam</hi> ſin, almoſt all kind of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes, as Pride, Gluttony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo is this of <hi>Davids</hi> a Rapſody and Fardel horribly compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and enwrapped with other ſins. And the wonder is enlarged in the greatneſs of theſe royal perſons, to whom God could have addreſt Angels, as he might in <hi>Adams</hi> cauſe, for he had thoſe wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Purſivants even then; as we read he did by a deſtructive execution of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in many thouſands by one Angel. 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19 35. And as he did even to <hi>David,</hi> puniſhing his other ſin of Pride by the ſword of a deſtroying Angel in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For Reſolution of this we learn firſt from ſome Interpreters, that this was done with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, becauſe there thoſe Kings offences were manifeſt, and had witneſſes enough; Theſe Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents ſinning the fruit, think to eſcape under the leaves, as if God could miſtake them for trees. To teach Rulers in ſuch caſes that Rule of <hi>Joh,</hi> in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the matter diligently: When <hi>Herod</hi> feared the ruine of his Kingdom by an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Infant, he
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:107154:159"/>enquired diligently of the <hi>Wiſe men</hi> all that could inform him for prevention. So all wiſe and juſt Judges both Soveraign and Dependant ought to be curious, and not to caſt to non-regardance the ſearch and tryal of groſs Offenders. For as on the one ſide no ſuch acceptable ſacrifice to God, and Angels, and good men, as the blood af a bloody Murderer, or ſuch like Monſter; No ſuch golden world as where great and grievous ſinners are ſhel'd and diſheltered from out their trees and fig-leaves, all preſumptions in wealth or power: So on the other ſide, The Lord beholds all Iniquity &amp; wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dealing, when by clear evidence of naked Truth, as in the example here, men are careleſs in judging or puniſhing their brethren. For if to accuſe be enough, you know who ſaid, none could be <hi>innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Which ſad and ſerious Jndagation of the Truth, and Execution of Judgement and Juſtice in inferior Courts would be a bleſſed ſight; where too commonly men crie that the Rod of coertion is turned into a devouring Serpent, or made an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-rod to fiſh for ſilver in the deep purſe of a mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſinner, where the gallant guilt-head or ſoul Porcpiſce, and all above his ſize ſhall eaſily break the line, or be let go; but the poor Pilcher is fetcht up with a vengeance, though his greateſt fault (perchance) be but <hi>Faut d'argent.</hi> But theſe are things like his <hi>Aruſpices,</hi> ever complained of, and evermore retained; and I do but only call upon them in my paſſage, being upon a point of Judgement here, which is executed immediately by the Almighty himſelf, to teach all Judges and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers (ſome think,) at leaſt in ſome crimes a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:107154:160"/>Inſpection. <hi>Solomon</hi> to that purpoſe hath a ſpeech of Kings ſitting in the Throne of Juſtice, and chaſing away all iniquity with their eyes. And as we read of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8. <hi>In Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem he ſet of the Levites, and of the 'Prieſts, and of the chief fathers of Iſrael;</hi> For what? <hi>For the Judgement of the Lord and for Controverſies:</hi> This was a Commiſſion; Yes, it was ſo to Prieſts and Levites, and chief Fathers of Iſrael. This was a ſtanding Court of Juſtice in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But the King himſelf in perſon at the fourth verſe goes through the people from <hi>Berſheba</hi> to mount <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi> — and ſets Judges in all the fenced Cities; and there he gives them a charge, a Caveat, with an <hi>Enim, — Take heed what you do, for you judge not for man, but for God,</hi> verſe 6.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Again, For Gods referring ſome to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Juſtice, and proceeding to immediate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, another reaſon is given, or another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is gained, (which is all one,) namely this, That if we can evade or elude humane Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, yet none ſhould be ſo ſhameleſs as to hope avoidance of him who is <hi>Supernus Inſpector;</hi> that holy One in his Watch-tower above: which <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> that lookt into the book of nature, markt in the uſual break of too great Greatneſs, — <hi>Res abdita quaedam;</hi> ſome hidden thing there was, ſo he ſtiles the divine Peovidence, — which did — <hi>Proculcare,</hi> — ſtill kick down the higheſt things, — <hi>Et ſibi Ludibrio habere,</hi> — ſeemed to take a pleaſure in ſo doing. And in the book of Scripture we find what deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:107154:160"/>God threatns oft, and oft ſeems delighted to bring upon the high ones of the world, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them low. So he ſeems to triumph over the <hi>Amorite,</hi> whoſe height was as the Cedars: yet I deſtroyed (ſaith he,) his friut from above, and his root from beneath. So he doth menance <hi>Edom,</hi> though high-rooſted and neſted among the ſtars, yet even thence will I fetch thee down, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.16. Theſe high ones may eſcape all Power on earth, but yet become the quarrie of him that is higher then the higheſt. So the Hern and Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture outflying both Falcon and gree-falcon are by the <hi>Sacre</hi> ſeized on in an inſtant, which fowl (as the name imports,) is made by all a Symbol and Hieroglyphick of the Deity, which in ſharpeſt Judgements comes horribly and ſpeedily upon wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governors in high places; which little of this Methode in Gods proceeding, may help us much againſt diſtruſt in Gods Providence, or fretting our ſouls too far againſt the Execution of his Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Thus far upon theſe words in a review, as they deliver us this Text taken in thoſe two parts, <hi>Of Judgement, and the Methode of that Judgement.</hi> Now we ſhall further make good our former Aſſertion that every part of Holy Scripture ſets open to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Expoſitors or Preachers, ſeveral doors of utterance. Be pleaſed in this laſt paſſage over the words to recall that which in the firſt Sermon I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Myſtick ſenſe of Gods queſtion here, that is, (for ſo I find it opened,) Where is thy former Happineſs?

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:107154:166"/>before we can come with comfort to take up that following Antheme of our Apoſtle, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Let us then labor <hi>(beloved in our Lord and Saviour,)</hi> to be truly <hi>humble in the ſenſe of this our Orphan, our relict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as alſo of the ſpreading venom and malignity of original corruption.

               <hi>Romans, By one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners;</hi> but expreſly, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>By one man ſin entred, and paſt over all.</hi> Theſe two contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are enough to break up the ſpring-head of our tears, and with ſtrong cries make us declare and deplore our miſery. But who believes our report, or who ſpends his tears upon this ſubject? We find a prophane <hi>Eſau crying cut with a great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bitter crie for the loſs of a bleſſing in the things of this life, Corn, and Wine, and Lordſhip, Gen.</hi> 27.34. And ſo I find even <hi>David werping and crying for a wicked ſon:</hi> And the earth is full of ſuch howling habitations for earthly grievances. But who will follow the example of <hi>David?

Such forcible entry makes this inborn corruption, that like the ſtrong man keeping poſſeſſion, or as a Sheriffe that hath <hi>Poſſe comitatus,</hi> and ſeiſes, and outs the owner, and bars him from the uſe of his goods: Such rule this unruly wickedneſs keeps in our hearts, and ſuch a ſway it bears, ſo that it is no longer I that do it, but <hi>ſin</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,) <hi>that raigns in me,</hi> and makes

They talk of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Balſom in mans body for all bodily diſeaſes: But were it not for a ſpiritual bleeding balm from that anointed holy Saviour, were it not for that double ſpring of Grace and Blood derivable to us, and to be let in upon us for the reviving and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of our fainting ſouls, what would become of our ſalvation? And though in that fountain ſet open for <hi>Judah</hi> &amp; for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for ſin and for tranſgre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion, I may waſh and be cleanſed from this leproſie: yet mark how that Goſpel begins, both in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Baptiſt, and his Maſter afterward, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,—and then the Kingdom of heaven is at hand, then the Kingdom of heaven is within you,</hi> that ſweet ſorrow of a contrite ſinner, that uſefull pulp of thoſe tears we fall at the ſight and feeling of our ſtrong corruptions, is beſt to make conſerve and preſerve of grace in our bearts, which God and his holy Angels beholding as it is <hi>Vinum Angelorum,</hi> making them rejoyce in Heaven, ſo himſelf will renew his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle upon ſuch ſouls, and turn that water into the wine of conſolation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, After this mournfull lecture of bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our loſs, and deprivation, and depravation na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Let me ſpeak a word in ſeaſon againſt that ſolemn ſin of <hi>Pride.</hi> Look to the rock from whence thou art hewn; Some boaſt of original deſcendings from famous Anceſtors, and yet too many ſons are born in original debt and diſeaſes of their Parents, of whom they are ſo apt to brag. But it is enough, and more for ever to ſtrip all ſorts of men out of all
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:107154:168"/>vain and mad dreſſings and coverings of themſelves under that miſhapen and monſtrous vice of Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance that here they find. — <hi>Illud quod dicere nolo.—Quod dici no lunt, &amp; dici potuiſſe, &amp; non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuiſſe refelli.</hi> That which men cannot endure to hear or think upon, we are all loth to turn and look upon our Fathers nakedneſs, not out of modeſty, as <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Jophet,</hi> but becauſe in height and pomp, and in the vaniry of high-ſoaring imaginations we ſtrive to forget both God, and him, and our ſelves. It is therefore that God in this Text comes ſtill, and calls after us, and ſhews us both the Receipt and the <hi>Probatum,</hi> two duſts; brings <hi>Adam</hi> in his hand, and preſents every man to himſelf, as in a general Glaſs of humane frailty. And this <hi>

How long will you love to belie your ſelves? — Quid ſuperbis?</hi> Why ſo goodly? O thou earth and aſhes! Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrons Incongruity to behold ſervants in the ſaddle, (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi>) and Princes to foot it by; but an incomprehenſible uglineſs in the looks of a proud man, when we look up to Heaven, and contemplate him that came down from Heaven for us men, came down indeed ſtript and empty of all his Glory. An incarnate, crucified, and humble God; Will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:107154:168"/>his main Precept, <hi>Learn of me;</hi> learn this above all thy Learning: Nor his Example, <hi>Behold, I have given you an example:</hi> Will nothing ſwage the ſwelling of thy proud ſtomack? Think yet there is no Grace but for the humble: no ſight of God and his Glory but for the meek. And if thou reſiſt that ſpirit of meekneſs which he ſhews thee in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and in his anointed (who if ever any mortal man is exhibted by God himſelf to all his people as a Pattern of Patience and Humility) thou ſhalt find a manifold ſenſe in that ſentence already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thee; <hi>God reſiſts the proud,</hi> that is, juſtles him in, and out of his own way of Pride, Renders him in the very acts and Elevations, in the hoiſting and ſpreading of all his ſails and wings, baſe, and contemptible, and ridiculous. God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many proud men by way of puniſhment to debauch themſelves with other vices, which yet do ſpring from thence; Reſiſting them in thoſe very things wherein they pleaſe themſelves, and hope to purchaſe Reverence, while by a moſt unſeemly ſuperciliouſneſs, by their haughty eye-lids, ſtiff necks, loud ſpeeches, oaths, Cloaths, Buildings, they occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the ſtorks bill behind their backs, and expoſe themſelves oft-times to open affronts and deriſions, and ſo are a kind of maſculine brood of new Muſes to the ſmal Poets and Wits of the time, and are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times juſtly made the ſongs of drunkards. And laſtly by approof of that in the Pſalmiſts Aphoriſm, <hi>Doubtleſs every man living in his beſt ſtate is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity,</hi> making their moſt ſtately and beſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht their moſt hopeful and high-erected for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, like <hi>Turnus</hi> his <hi>perſidus enſis,</hi> or like blown
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:107154:169"/>glaſs, — <hi>Cum ſplendet, frangitur,</hi> in the ſtretch and wreſting broken, in their very acme and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation ruinous; and as ſmoak, when moſt ſupream, then to neareſt vaniſhing, with a <hi>Sic tranſit;</hi> which is no new experiment: every age affording ſuch Coments and Meteors, exhaled and paſt their bounds when they have crackt a while and blaz'd, fall or ſhoot, or are hurled down to their firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal droſsineſs; ſo becoming like the <hi>Hiſtorians Sword-chariots,</hi> to the World at firſt a terror, and afterwards a Scorn: Men we ſee literally fulfilling that concluſive prediction, Man cannot abide in honor; which fatal frequent Event is enough to make us imagine a Favorite to be an unlawfull Calling, but that we find exceptions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in Gods own book, where we have example of his own rich friend <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom he honoured as his familiar; and <hi>John</hi> the Favorite of our gracious Saviour. And in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of former, and for the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of ſucceeding times, we find, and look upon ſome, <hi>e meliore luto,</hi> whoſe ardent and ethereal vertue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them in the love, and preſervation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almighty, as ſo many ſtreight and noble Palms under a royal Cedar, ſtill freſh and unblaſted, as far from ſelf-wickedneſs as others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, which is a rare complexion in felicity.</p>
            <p>There is a fourth uſe or extraction to be had out of this, by teaching us all to turn upon our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon adverſary; I mean ſin, that thus firſt threw the ball of wild-fire to the ruine of our Fathers houſe, and ſtate, and race; this is truly the noble ſcience of defence, and the only bravery of reſiſtance;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:107154:169"/>Here then learn to ſhew mettle, courage, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and reſolution. Alas! What a wretched feable and ſquib valor is it for a man to contend in blood with him that gives him then the lie, when he moſt deſerves it? or ſpeaks diſgraceingly of her to him who in his own conſcience knows, he firſt and moſt hath made her liable to that reproach and diſhonour, and yet this ſame man ſo rank a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, as he dare not enter the lifts, nor ſtand the Combat, and conflict with this Adverſary! No, no, my brother of the ſword is fouly miſtaken in judging of true courage, and muſt know that he is the poor unworthy, the only baſe and bafled fellow, that ſcorns not to be a fellow, that weakly yields to be a ſervant, and a Priſoner, and a voluntary ſlave to ſin, his mortal enemy, and content to be taken captive of the devil to do his will.</p>
            <p>So in the point of Wiſdom, and true prudential policy, (which we all affect,) doth it ſhew vilely of? May it not ſtand with the temper of a right En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh conſtitution, to ſubmit to Covenants and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles with that pernitious foe, who by invaſion ſeeks to enthral and trample on, and bereave us both of ſtate and liberty? What is it then to ſtrike an everlaſting league with ſin, and ſo with death and hell, (for ſin is their Agent, their leiger Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,) and not rather conſpire to draw up all our Auxiliary forces of rectified Reaſon, and moral Precepts, but ſpecially confiding in coeleſtial aids of Angels, and Influences of divine Grace and Aſsiſtance, to root out the body of ſin and death, root and branch; or as it is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. with a <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, That at leaſt ſin may no longer raign and have
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:107154:170"/>Dominion.</hi> Here every Chriſtian Souldier, marching under the Enſign of the Croſs of Jeſus, is to bid Defiance, and to run <hi>ad Arma,</hi> thoſe eſpecially of <hi>Preces &amp; Lachrymae:</hi> The weapons of this War-fare are ſpiritual, but yet able through God to beat down the ſtrongeſt holds of Satan; And for this cauſe we ſhould be watchfull over ſins advantages, of which I will make my concluſion, and preſent a few, and ſuch as I find here in this ſtory, and in this example.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, The ſerpentine nature of ſin is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And all ſins may ſay, <hi>Documenta damus qua ſimus origine,</hi> from the devil in the Serpent they draw their property of Inſinuation. And yet to ſee, as the ſame Devil prevailed even at <hi>Rome,</hi> to be worſhipt in form of a Serpent, (you know the ſtory of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi>) and the notice of that too in the <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> The Dragon worſhipt at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> So <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reckons up among his <hi>Hereticks,</hi> thoſe that worſhipt that very Serpent in Paradiſe, as the Author for ſooth of Science. But as we muſt all be cautelous of any ſuch ſerpentine perſwaſions in the caſe of any ſin: and as all great ones are to eſchew the danger of Flatterers, the worſt of all tame beaſts: ſo a Caveat here will not be unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able againſt the Romiſh Synagogue of a ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine brood, — <hi>Stillant in aure venenum,</hi> creep into houſes, and ſeduce ſilly women. Againſt ſuch Serpents, bleſs God for <hi>Ibides,</hi> Birds that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that crawling generation by confounding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the Truth of God; And learn even for that very cauſe, to think well of ſuch at leaſt as either in the former Age of Reformation, or in this
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:107154:170"/>preſent time, from Cathedral Prelacy, or other rule have ſtood up (next under God, and a gracious Soveraign,) the Pen-champions and Defenders of the Faith, as well againſt that brood, as the other dangerous extream of Sectaries,</p>
            <p n="2">2, A ſecond obſervation is the advantage gained by the Tempter in that way (as we ſhould think) of diſadvantage in the harſh unpleſant hiſſing of the Serpent. We wonder at the She-wolves affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt ill favoured Male, and bleſs our ſelves to think, (as well we may,) that Witches ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in blood, and endure thoſe horrid approaches which thrill our ſouls to imagine; And yet we take no notice, that in every groſs ſin we are as groſs and foul as they: For inſtance, Do but weigh the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of whoredom, — He follows her as an Ox to the ſlaughter, and as a fool to the ſtocks for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; As a Bird haſtes to the ſnare, till a dart ſtrike through his liver, the ſeat of his luſt, — Is not this man bewitcht, drawn by the devil down to hell? ſo ſaith <hi>Solomon, Her feet go down to death, and her ſteps take hold on hell:</hi> And that the hiſs of ſuch a Serpent ſhould be acceptable muſick, is it not as ſtrange as <hi>Eves</hi> tentation here? <hi>Doth not the Wiſdom of God lead men to find this true in wofull trial.</hi> confeſſed ſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.12. He wonders how he was ſo bewitcht, <hi>How have I hated Inſtruction?</hi> and then mourning bewails the ſhame and laſting brand of Infamy upon that ſin. I was almoſt brought, into what? into all evil: And where? In the midſt of the Congregation, in the face of the world. But above all, is that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, which makes it more horrible then Witchcraft, or their Converſe with foul ſpirits; for
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:107154:171"/>he tels us, it is in myſtick ſenſe an Abaſing, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of the fleſh and bones of Chriſt; <hi>Shall I take the members of Chriſt, and make them the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of an Harlot?</hi> Is not he or ſhe worſe then a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, would draw me to do that?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sins advantage was on the womans ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to ſleight Gods prohibition, where Satans deadlieſt dart (as ever ſince we find it,) was thrown upon the fear of God, which being in all good ſouls the beginning of all Wiſdom, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrives to rob us of that Jewel, firſt to put out that eye, and then <hi>Polyphemus</hi>-like we rome about in Darkneſs and Diſtemper. Let the fear of the Lord then be the Levite in every private family, in every boſom, not to be parted from it all the dayes of our lives. Believe the Lord, and love not to trie concluſions. The ambitious man knows by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Trials in others, how hard his condition is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wheel, how unſafe to tarry, and how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to diſlodge from his mountain-ſituation; and yet this Pill is ſwallowed; This ſhirt of the ſoul muſt not off, till skin and all go with it. So every lying <hi>Gthazi,</hi> every corrupt and bribing Courtier knows how uncurable a plague will purſue him, and yet ventures for two talents, and two change of Rayment. So to the Sacrilegious, may we not ſay, as the Prophet of Oppreſſion, <hi>Do not theſe Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors that ſuck the blood of Orphans, and rifle widdows houſes, and they that like Bels Priſts, eate up the houſe of God and all his proviſion, and yet jeaſt it away with the Apothegme of the wiſe Silver-ſmith,</hi> Sirs, you know that by this Craft we have our livings, our livings indeed, of which, ſome one man may be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and diſpenced with all in his own ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:107154:171"/>to hold twenty, marry they are impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or rather Sequeſtrations: And do not all theſe ſeveral Oppreſſors know the ſentence of God gone out againſt them? Do not they againſt their own conſcience with-hold the truth of God in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? and yet they would have us ſay nothing, as if we were bound to this immodeſt forbearance of pronouncing and denouncing Gods Judgements, <hi>But the Word of God is not bound,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle: So let me apply in a word to the Blaſphemer, and the falſe Swearer; He hears indeed a rumor from a Prophet, a great while ago, in another Country far of, of a roul of plagues flying in the air, and entering into the Swearers houſe, and deſtroying foundations; but he rowls in wealth and eaſe, and believes it not. And theſe ſtartlers at oaths, whoſe ſtomacks are ſo queaſie, he hath markt it, (he can tell you,) that commonly they die Beggars.</p>
            <p>I have but one advantage more of ſin, in one word more to note unto you, of which we yet may make our beſt advantage; it is not in, but will fairly comply with the Text: It is <hi>Deſpair,</hi> which many times the Tempter begets upon preſumption; He makes them firſt preſumptuous, and then deſperate ſinners. At firſt it is, <hi>Rejoyce O young man,</hi> What needſt thou fear? at laſt, there is no repenting now, <hi>perſcelera;</hi> The ſafeſt way is to go through. But then againſt this charm, remember thou the voice of thy Creator, <hi>As I live;</hi> and the voice of thy Redeemer, <hi>As I was content to die, I would not have the death of a ſinner.</hi> Think of that ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Reſtorer of all our loſſes; and in the loweſt of thy declination to a deſperate ſadneſs, uſe this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, <hi>Where art thou man? Why art thou ſo heavy
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:107154:172"/>O my ſoul, ſo diſquiet within me?</hi> Put thy truſt in God, I know in whom I believe, there is all I can hope for, wiſh for, above all that I am able to ask or think. His blood ſhall waſh away all my ſins, though ſcarlet bloody ſins; His Robe is pure, and large, and odorous, I will put it on, I will put him on, and then my ſoul, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> to what an height of bravery, to what illuſtrious Enobling, to what a Royalty, to what a Crown and Dignity, art thou advanet! and if our riſing thoughts ſhall mount from hence, and take their flight into the preſence, and before the Throne of Grace and Glory there, how might this conſolation be up-heaped, and yet run over, and exceed all humane apprehenſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A Collection of ſeveral mens Diſcourſes and Opinions concerning <hi>Duels:</hi> Ont of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtory tranſtated into <hi>French</hi> by <hi>Mayerne,</hi> this Diſcourſe following was excerpted, and thus engliſhed.</head>
            <p>IF of two evils, we muſt make choice of one, (as ſome men ſay in this caſe of Duels is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,) the faſhion of ſingle Combats practiſed by our Anceſtors will eaſily appear more tolerable then that in uſe at this day. For by the former was diſcovered a kind of proof in things ambiguous, and in them the Princes Pleaſure, or his lawfull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates was requiſite, who firſt of all took notice, whether the cauſe deſerved to put two perſons of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:107154:172"/>honor or quality in danger of life, who might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerve the publique under their Soveraign, or be uſefull in their proper families. If after mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, they judged the matter muſt come to that trial and iſſue, it was with very great caution, and manifold Ceremonies, to teſtifie how carefull men were in that age of mens lives. There was Order taken for the equaling of the Combatants, to ſee that no advantage was given in arms, or in the ſtrength or furniture of their horſes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. They were both depoſed concerning wrong accuſation of each other, and that they came both freely for a good and juſt quarrel, and only for the maintenance of their honor. The point and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which honor in thoſe days, was placed in the worſhip of God Almighty, allegiance to the King, and ſervice to thoſe Lords, of whom they had dependencies; and in loyalty and truth towards all men, courteous, peaceable, and modeſt among friends; feirce, valiant, and full of courage againſt their enemy in war. And if upon this point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, upon knowledge that any man had been falſly accuſed, offended, or out-raged in word or deed, by advantage either of time, place, company, inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Weapons, or Arms unlawfull, or unuſual, or otherwiſe had juſt cauſe to complain, there was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy means for Redreſs of the injury, as the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; Order taken according to Law, or milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cuſtom, which would not admit any Duel, ſaving only when there was no other Remedy; much lefs would they ſuffer any Gentleman of honor to put himſelf upon an uncertain proof of arms with any one convict of raſh or manifeſt calumny. And then the faſhion was, that he that was vanquiſht, was
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:107154:173"/>eſteemed culpable, and counted thenceforth a Lyar, and Slanderer; and if he had his life, yet he was ever puniſht with ſome diſgrace or degradation.</p>
            <p>Beſides, For the moſt part, the Combate was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued or ended at the diſcretion of the Prince, or his Subſtitutes, which alſo did moſt commonly part the Duelliſts, and not ſuffer them to proceed to the utterance, but pronounced them both good and approved Cavaliers upon the place, which was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their prudent affection to preſerve noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for better uſes. But if any were found of ſo proud &amp; contumacious ſtomack, as having no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to procure leave to fight, whether in place near adjacent or further remote where they could obtain room and liberty to combate, they might never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter return unto their native home again, but were eſteemed as Mutinous, in the condition of Felons and Traitors to their Prince, unleſs they obtained Letters Patent of aboliſhing their crime.</p>
            <p>But amongſt us all this is out of uſe; and the Procedure of our modern Duelliſts far different. For if it chance that ſome light or ignorant young fellow, do now give affront or offence unto another without cauſe, the point of Honor forſooth obliges the Offendor to make good his inſolent deed; and he muſt neither confeſs nor frame any excuſe of his fault, for that is held a ſign of vanity and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe. And better it is to appear raſh and proud, then abaſe himſelf to a modeſty, which among men of the ſword is counted Puſillanimity. Another reſenting too deep what is but ſpoken by his friend in jeaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or freedom of language, which contains no real injury at all, will yet be ſo tranſported, that no repair or ſatisfaction ſhall ſerve; and why? becauſe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:107154:173"/>he ſtands upon the Punctilioes of Reputation. And a Gentleman muſt rather preſerve himſelf thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully and incompatibly, then uſe any ſuch facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or weakneſs as ſhall derogate from true Chivalrie. Nor can any former converſation, or Amity reſtrain his fury, but fight he will; If it ſo happens that the Prince or any grand Magiſtrate will intermedle, or enquire after their quarrel; O then theſe Gallants are more fearfull of ſuch Judgement then of Thunder: They avoid it by all means, and you muſt run after them, and they will fight in private; whether the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be, that they are aſhamed to diſcover the ground of their debate, which is oftentimes ſo feeble and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, that themſelves know not how to ſpeak of it without bluſhing; or whether the head-long and unquenchable deſire of ſhedding mans blood have prepoſſeſſed them with an eager appetite of revenge, mingled with extream haughtineſs and folly. Better it is (ſay they,) to ſhew themſelves indocible and rebellious, then to ſubmit to ſuch a Diſcipline; for then every man would taunt them for want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and that their cowardize conſtrained them to ſhun the field: Hence they grow upon the point of honor, to conclude that it belongs to no Prince by Juſtice to limit their appointments. And that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is to acknowledge no other Equity or Law, but what the continued cuſtom of Gallants hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, which gives them authority to do any thing and ſuffer nothing; and by the ſword to maintain themſelves in that priviledge moſt unjuſtly and falſly uſurpt, which the manners of the age have ſet before them.</p>
            <p>So that men in this age muſt pretend neither fear of God, nor King, nor royal Edicts to the contrary,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:107154:174"/>but upon the challenge readily preſent themſelves in the field, or elſe refuſing be reputed for baſe Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troons faln from all franchiſe and nobleneſs of mind, and from thence ever to be expoſed to all outrages of the Challenger at his will and pleaſure. For the point of honor teaches a man to chuſe rather the appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an <hi>Aſſaſine,</hi> then to enter the combate with any ſuch as are bafled, and have refuſed to anſwer a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. And when theſe men meet upon the encounter of a ſelf-choſen Duel, though but in their ſhirts, yet muſt they run deſperately &amp; brutiſhly upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſwords, rather then turn aſide from a thruſt that preſents it ſelf, or to rebate, &amp; put it by with any care of ones own ſafety, and die rather then ſhew the leaſt geſture or countenance of fearing death: ſo that the wonder is, how this kind of Bravoes, (which ſeem born into the world for butcheries and maſſacres, &amp; either to kill or to be killed,) can yet when they go to the wars, think it no abaſement to cover themſelves with ſtrong armor, after the example of the antient Warriors. But yet behold a more refined and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſential point of Honor; for it is permitted to our Duelliſts, to invite a ſecond and a third, if ſo they pleaſe, which are all engaged and obliged to fight it out to the laſt againſt an equal number choſen on the other part, and ſo to kill thoſe with whom they never had quarrel or debate; but on the contrary are their own intimate friends, as it is often ſeen. This is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth the law of Duel; and you muſt chuſe rather (ſaith the point of Honor,) to murder a dear friend, then refuſe the requeſt of a Cavalier that doth you the ſpecial favour and honor of being his Second in a quarrel, be it right or wrong. This is counted a kind of lawfull and honourable murder; and then you are
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:107154:174"/>to account it upon the advantage more noble to kill your oppoſite outright, then to give him his life, when he is at your mercy, unleſs peradventure he be ſo baſe to beg it. So there is a double harveſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown to be reaped from Duels; that is, either to murder a man, or elſe be able to vaunt that you gave him his life. If the Vanquiſher come off wounded, and die ſhortly after it, yet he comforts himſelf in point of honor ſtill, that he bath done himſelf reaſon with his own ſword, and that his Adverſary is dead before him. But for any remedy of their ſouls health, they con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive they have ſufficiently provided, if going to the combate with hearts full of rancorous hate and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deſpight to their neighbour, poſſeſt with aſpirit of vengeance, mixt with a vain opinion of their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, dignity and valour, they throw themſelves upon their knees in ſome Church or Chappel, and pray to God with all their hearts, that he will be pleaſed to give them the Grace to kill their enemie, or conſtrain him to confeſs he holds his life from them: And if perchance they meet a Church-may by the way that hath any ſenſe or conſcience, and will take the pains by ſome ſacred Remonſtrances to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert one of theſe fellows from their miſchievous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he will anſwer him with a <hi>Tuſh,</hi> and tell him, <hi>Sir,</hi> you underſtand nothing of the point of honor, or elſe depart in choler, or make a mock of his good counſel. But alas! theſe men muſt needs be far from all that's ſacred, when we ſee they never conſult ſo much as with any man of diſcretion that knows what belongs to true honor and nobleneſs indeed. But they take all their Inſtructions in this falſe point of honor from the ſuggeſtions of mans enemy the devil, <hi>who being a Murderer from the beginning, delights
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:107154:175"/>evermore in blood-ſhed and deſtruction.</hi> By his Inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and leading on we ſee them go in a gay Gallantry &amp; Bravery to let out their unhappy fouls, being men for the moſt part that have ever lived without God, or King, or Law, or Charity, and ſtrangers to all humane and civil ſociety, placing all vertue in that maſtiff kind of valiant going on, which lewdly they miſcal <hi>Courage,</hi> which is a thing common to them with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage beaſts, and which yet they uſe on all occaſions.</p>
            <p>If ever there was any Barbariſm equal to this ſince the foundation of the world, let thoſe judge that have but any ſpark of a rational ſoul within them; or is there any thing amongſt humane actions or devices more repugnant to the Law of God, more abſurd in nature, more dammageable to the Policies and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of Common-wealths, more derogatory to Princes and Magiſtrates, and in ſome more criminal, in relation to divine and humane Majeſty, then theſe modern Duels! and though ſome have been allowed in ſome caſe; by former tolerations, yet out of all queſtion, if we take them in the beſt Form that was ever practiſed, (unleſs againſt an open enemy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking and challenging in the open face of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,) (as the caſe of <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi>) and they are but the inventions of nations cruel and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, that never knew true Juſtice or Policy, much leſs Piety, leaſt of all Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus far I gathered from that Spaniſh Hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hear now a late Divine of our own, how roundly he damns this diſorder, <hi>(D. D.)</hi> It is an hard war (ſaith he) that againſt ſin, and which preſſes us all our life long, and in it are no <hi>Emeriti,</hi> no diſcharge in that War-fare, and yet we fight inhumane Duels, <hi>

            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawliegh</hi> tells of Combats recorded in Scripture and Hiſtory of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies againſt Chalengers, twelve of <hi>Juda</hi> againſt twelve <hi>Benjamites;</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi> thoſe of the three <hi>Horatii</hi> againſt the three <hi>Albani Curiatii;</hi> Mr. <hi>Torquatus,</hi> and <hi>Val Corvinus</hi> againſt two <hi>Gauls;</hi> and with us, <hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi> againſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> for the Kingdom. In <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time, thirty <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt thirty <hi>Britains,</hi> whereof <hi>Calverly</hi> and <hi>Knols</hi> were two. In <hi>Richard</hi> the ſeconds time, a Combat appointed twixt <hi>Hertford</hi> and <hi>Mowbray,</hi> one fought by <hi>Anſley</hi> &amp; <hi>Cotrington</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of Treaſon, wherein <hi>Anſley</hi> was victorious. In accuſation for Treaſon, or according to the Laws of <hi>Normandy</hi> for murder, rape or burning of places, the party overcome was to ſuffer death; but for trial of Right it was not ſo, nor the Appellant or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant bound to perſonal trial, but might do it by their Champions; and in this caſe the beaten party, or that yielded, loſt only his cauſe, and this was in Camp cloſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt ordinary in <hi>France,</hi> (till St. <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Philip le Faire</hi> his Grand-ſon,) ſo that every Lord of the Fee, clerical or temporal, could grant it in his Juriſdiction, and Kings and Lords made profit of it; for if a drawn battle, both paid 2 ſ. 6 d. but if fought, the vanquiſhed paid 112 ſ. thence the Proverb of <hi>Bearn</hi> Law or <hi>Loray, Ou Le Battu Paye l'amende,</hi> (Sir <hi>W. Rawleigh</hi> what follows.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:107154:176"/>Of theſe Trials by battle, <hi>Ino</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres</hi> oft complained, ſpecially againſt the Eccleſiaſticks rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſuch Challenges; but <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trencht that Power only to Kings. In thoſe Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on Treaſon, Murder, or any crime that was death by the Law, (and in none elſe,) the Rule held, <hi>Le Defenſeur eſtoit tenu de propoſes ces defenſes per une dementir;</hi> otherwiſe it was concluded he did <hi>taiſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confeſſer le crime.</hi> But after <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt gave the Lye to <hi>Charls</hi> the fift, Emperor, every petite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in <hi>France,</hi> in imitation made the Lye mortal, and brag'd that the worſt Gentleman there was braver then the Emperor.</p>
            <p>And from hence in our time, every man arrogates a Kingly liberty to offer, accept and appoint perſonal Combats, and the giving the lye (which ought to be the negation only in accuſations for life,) is become the moſt fruitfull root of deadly quarrels. This is held a word ſo terrible, a wrong ſo unpardonable, that no other recompence but blood. Whence we have derived an Art and Philoſophy of quarrel, with certain grounds and rules, from whence the point of Honor, and the Dependencies are deduc'd, with many ridiculous and myſtick curioſities; as a blow with a Cane, relating to a ſlave, ſhall be more diſhonor then a ſword, in reference to a ſouldier. Yet who would not make that exchange?</p>
            <p>Examine this Lye with their condition, who are moſt tender in receiving it, and preſent death on the ſwords point to the Giver; yet they uſe nothing more in their converſation then ſpeaking and ſwearing falſly; yea it is thereby that they ſhift and ſhuffle in the world, and abuſe it; for who more break faith and word, and oath engaged to pay what they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:107154:176"/>and being ſued, are thereby proved Lyars up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record; nay, in Complements, and vowing our ſervices, what is there but a courtly kind of lying? <hi>Your ſervant Sir;</hi> like the word <hi>Vertue</hi> in the end of an Uſurers obligation, in as full force without it; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne marche &amp; complot faite enſemble de ſe mocker, mentir, &amp; piper les uns, les autres;</hi> yet he that uſes it not, is counted a <hi>Dulman,</hi> or <hi>Cynick.</hi> And yet further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider we that he that gives another man the Lye, when it is manifeſt he hath lyed, doth him no wrong at all; nor ought to be more hainouſly taken, then to ſay, <hi>He hath broken Promiſe, or failed his Truſt, which amounts to a lye.</hi> On the other ſide, when I give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the lye, and know in my own conſcience he hath not lyed, I give the Lye to my ſelf. And what cauſe have I, if I ſay, <hi>the Sun ſhines, when it doth ſhine,</hi> and another tels me it is a Lye, for it is midnight, to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute ſuch a one to death for making himſelf a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ruffin and Lyar in his own knowledge! So that to give it in any caſe, (except of Loyalty and Life) is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and irrational.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> They object. Theſe Diſcourſes ſavour of Cowardize. I anſwer; 'Tis true, if they call it Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to fear God or hell, whereas the truly wiſe or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant knows there is nothing elſe to be feared. For againſt an enemies ſword we find 10000 ſeven-penny men wag'd at that price in the wars, that fear it as little, perchance leſs, then any proſeſt ſword-man in the world. <hi>Diligentiſſima in tutela ſui fortitudo;</hi> and it is (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>) a mediocrity between doubting and daring. <hi>Sicut non martyrem poena,</hi> ſo not fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a good cauſe declares the valiant man; In which whoſoever ſhall reſolvedly end his life, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly I mean in reſpect of the cauſe, to wit, in defence of his Prince, Religion, or Country as he may juſtly
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:107154:177"/>be numbred among the Martyrs of God; ſo may thoſe that die with malicious hearts in private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats or Duels be called the Martyrs of the Devil. Neither indeed do we take our own Revenge, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Injuries offered us by the death of the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For the true conqueſt of revenge, is to give him, of whom he would be revenged, cauſe to repent him; and we lay the Repentance of another mans blood upon our own conſcience, and drown our ſouls in the wounds of our enemies.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Objection or Demand will be: <hi>Do I condemn generous defence of Honor preſt with Injury?</hi> I anſwer; No, if the Injury be violent; for the Law of nature which is a branch of the eternal Law, and the Laws of all Chriſtian Kings and States do favour him that is aſſail'd in the ſlaughter of the aſſailant; but no Gentleman, on a Chartel, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge being defied, is bound to anſwer in point of Honor in a private combate, becauſe (omitting the greateſt, which is the point of Religion,) the point of Law is directly contrary, which hath dominion over the point of Honor, which can judge it, which can deſtroy it, except you will ſtile thoſe Arts honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, where the hang-man gives the Garland. For the Laws of the Land having appointed the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſecond the Conqueror, and the Laws of God appointed the Devil to ſecond the Conquered dying in malice, I ſay he is baſe, and alſo a fool that accepts of any Chartel ſo accompanied.</p>
            <p>A third Objection, How ſhall a noble or gentle man be repaired in Honor for Infamy unſufferable? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> By the Court martial; For do we not in caſes of debts, goods, lands, and all things elſe ſubmit (without diſgrace) to law, becauſe it may be felony to take by violence that which is our own? And if Honor
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:107154:177"/>be dearer then goods, or life it ſelf, yet know what is true Honor; It is the Hiſtory or Fame following Acts of Vertue, or Acts of difficulty, and danger for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good. He that in theſe fails by Cowardize or baſe affection, is diſhonoured; but acting a private Combate for a private reſpect, and moſt commonly a frivolous one, is no act of vertue, becauſe contrary to Gods Law and the Kings, nor difficult, (on even terms) nor for publique good, but contrary. For a man may be <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> robbing ſo his King and Country: as for contumelious words, if I cauſe my enemy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, be ſorry, or make amends, all theſe, or any are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and the diſ-reputation is not mine, but his: and for matter of Fact or Blows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> famous is that deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>French Marſhals</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Monſieur de Pleſſis</hi> ſtruck by a Baron, which was awarded to kneel before Mr. <hi>Pl.</hi> in open Court ſitting in his Chair, and to tender him a ſword and a cudgil, and <hi>Pleſſis</hi> to chuſe with which he would ſtrike, but he for gave him: and which of theſe two had the diſgrace? If you ſay the Barons Repentance was enforced, and ſo no diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to him, you may as much alledge for a thief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing at the Gallows that his Repentance is enforced too, &amp; ſo all enforced repentance is inflicted upon us for ſomething done unworthy of a Gentleman or an honeſt man, and therefore the Court of Chivalry moſt chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; for the blood of men violently ſpilt, doth not bring forth hony bees, as that of Buls doth, which ſting but the fingers or the face, but it produces that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous beaſt, <hi>Revenge,</hi> which hath devoured ſo many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonages of ſeveral nations, as there is nothing more lamentable, nor more threatning the wrath of God upon ſupream Governors then the permiſſion; therefore K. <hi>James</hi> extinguiſht thoſe deadly <hi>Feuds</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and our Laws are ſtrong againſt Duelliſts in <hi>England.</hi>

For firſt, The whole skie of women are cleer againſt it; &amp; among the males, all nobler ſpirits fitted for Counſel, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will learn to look down with ſcorn upon it: Beggars and the poorer Tribes can live and die with a few brawls, or broken-heads at moſt. The three profeſſions are better taught, finding no Aphoriſm or Law of God or man to defend it; and men of Trade and Corporations underſtand not the word</hi> Puſineſs <hi>in the quarrelling Dialect: ſo that fighting is confin'd; it deſcends not uſually beneath a ſerving-man, nor aſcends above a knight. And being thus compreſt, the hope is, it will ſhortly vaniſh into nothing, for it riſes from that which is next to Nothing, Vanity, and Lyes, and Vapors, in Tap-houſes and Taverns. And you ſhall obſerve ſuch gueſts ſtill more tender of that dreadful word the</hi> Lye, <hi>on whom it falls in the nature of a true jeaſt; and ſuch moſt enrag'd about Reputation, whom wiſe men know to have little or no Reputation to loſe.

Can they ſhew me from all that ſtory a pair of worthy Courages (out take the merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fencers,) embrandled and enkindled to go forth and fight a Duel for the Lye, or the ſon of a whore; or any ſuch poor froth as flies from men in wrath, or vext with diſtemper in drink, or play?
